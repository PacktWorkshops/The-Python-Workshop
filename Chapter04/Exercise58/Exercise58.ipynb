At the back, wide glass doors open upon\\na terrace which overlooks an English landscape. It is winter, and coals\\nare burning in the fireplace. On each side of the glass doors are\\nrounded recesses with windows. On one side of the room a door opens into\\nthe library. On the other side is a door to the hall--the chief entrance\\nof the house. The room is handsomely furnished in eighteenth century\\nstyle._ MR. _and_ MRS. BENNET _are discovered sitting on either side of\\nthe table._ MRS. BENNET _is knitting--_MR. BENNET _reading._\\n\\n\\nMRS. BENNET.\\n\\n[_After a slight pause and laying down her knitting._]\\n\\nMy dear Mr. Bennet, did not you hear me? Did you know that Netherfield\\nPark is let at last?\\n\\n\\nMR. BENNET.\\n\\n[_Continues reading and does not answer._]\\n\\n\\nMRS. BENNET.\\n\\n[_Impatiently._] Do not you want to know who has taken it?\\n\\n\\nMR. BENNET.\\n\\n[_Ceases reading and looks up at her with an amused smile._] You want to\\ntell me, and I have no objection to hearing it.\\n\\n\\nMRS. BENNET.\\n\\n[_With animation._] Why, my dear, you must know Lady Lucas says that\\nNetherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the North of\\nEngland. His name is Bingley, and he is _single_, my dear. Think of\\nthat, Mr. Bennet! A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand\\npounds a year. What a fine thing for our girls!\\n\\n\\nMR. BENNET.\\n\\nHow so? How can it affect them?\\n\\n\\nMRS. BENNET.\\n\\nMy dear Mr. Bennet, how can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am\\nthinking of his marrying one of them.\\n\\n\\nMR. BENNET.\\n\\nIs that his design in settling here?\\n\\n\\nMRS. BENNET.\\n\\nDesign!--Nonsense! How can you talk so? But it is very likely that he\\nwill fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as\\nsoon as you can. Consider your daughters, Mr. Bennet! Only think what an\\nestablishment it would be for one of them! Sir William and Lady Lucas\\nare determined to go merely on that account. Indeed you must go, for it\\nwill be impossible for us to visit him if _you_ do not.\\n\\n\\nMR. BENNET.\\n\\n[_Who has risen during this last speech and now stands with his back to\\nthe fire, facing_ MRS. BENNET.] You are overscrupulous, surely. I dare\\nsay Mr. Bingley will be very glad to see you, and I will send a few\\nlines to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he\\nchooses of the girls--though I must throw in a good word for my little\\nLizzy.\\n\\n\\nMRS. BENNET.\\n\\n[_Sharply._] I desire you will do no such thing! Lizzy is not a bit\\nbetter than the others. She is not half as handsome as Jane, nor as\\ngood-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving her the preference.\\n\\n\\nMR. BENNET.\\n\\nNot unless she deserves it, my dear. But in this particular instance my\\npoor little Lizzy is the only one who is unprovided for. Lydia and the\\nothers belong in the schoolroom, and you tell me that Mr. Collins has\\nalready spoken for Jane.\\n\\n\\nMRS. BENNET.\\n\\nOh, that odious Mr. Collins! I wish he had never come here. I wish I\\nmight never hear his name again!\\n\\n\\nMR. BENNET.\\n\\nMr. Collins odious! You surprise me! I thought that he had won your full\\napproval.\\n\\n\\nMRS. BENNET.\\n\\n[_Fretfully._] Oh, well, since he had to be your cousin, and since you\\n_will_ not do anything about the entail, I suppose it will be a mercy if\\nhe does marry Jane. [_Half crying._] But I do think, Mr. Bennet, it is\\nthe hardest thing in the world that we have no son of our own, so that\\nyour property has to be entailed away from your own wife and children,\\nso if you should die, we may all be turned out of the house whenever\\nthis Mr. Collins pleases. [_In bewailing tone._] He certainly does seem\\nto have all the luck in the world. Here he has just got this good living\\nfrom that grand Lady Catherine de Bourg.\\n\\n\\nMR. BENNET.\\n\\nBut, my dear, that will soon be _your_ luck, as well. You forget that\\nyour daughter is to profit by it.\\n\\n\\nMRS. BENNET.\\n\\nWell, perhaps. I don\\'t know about _that_, but, [_With renewed\\nexcitement._] I _do_ know that it is too monstrous that after you are\\ngone I shall be forced to make way for this man and live to see him\\nmaster in this house!\\n\\n\\nMR. BENNET.\\n\\nMy dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts. Let us hope for better\\nthings. Let us flatter ourselves that I may be the survivor.\\n\\n\\nMRS. BENNET.\\n\\n[_This is not very consoling to_ MRS. BENNET; _and therefore, instead of\\nmaking answer, she goes on as before._] If it was not for the entail I\\nshould not mind it.\\n\\n\\nMR. BENNET.\\n\\nWhat should not you mind?\\n\\n\\nMRS. BENNET.\\n\\nI should not mind anything at all.\\n\\n\\nMR. BENNET.\\n\\nLet us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such\\ninsensibility. But it certainly is a most iniquitous affair, and nothing\\ncan clear Mr. Collins from the guilt of inheriting Longbourn. However,\\nyou know he is doing his best to mend matters. He has not only\\nhandsomely apologised for his fault, but he has now assured us of his\\nreadiness to make every possible amends by marrying one of the girls.\\nSurely, my dear, you must acknowledge that this plan is excessively\\ngenerous on his part.\\n\\n\\nMRS. BENNET.\\n\\n[_Dolefully._] Well, I suppose it might be worse.\\n\\n\\nMR. BENNET.\\n\\n[_Cheerfully._] Decidedly worse. With Jane so well settled, and a single\\nman like Mr. Bingley in prospect, I think you should be quite cheerful.\\n\\n\\nMRS. BENNET.\\n\\n[_Excited once more._] Mr. Bingley! We shall never know Mr. Bingley. Oh,\\nMr. Bennet, you take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion on my\\npoor nerves.\\n\\n\\nMR. BENNET.\\n\\nYou mistake, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They are my\\nold friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration these\\ntwenty years at least.\\n\\n\\nMRS. BENNET.\\n\\nAh! You do not know what I suffer.\\n\\n\\nLYDIA.\\n\\n[_Bursting into the room, followed by_ JANE.] Oh, that horrid practice!\\n[_Looking back at_ JANE.] Jane does so keep me at it. [_Throwing herself\\ninto a chair._] La, I\\'m tired to death.\\n\\n\\nJANE.\\n\\n[_Who sees that her mother is half crying, goes and stands behind her\\nchair, puts her hand affectionately on her shoulder, and bends over\\nher._] Does your head ache, mamma?\\n\\n\\nMRS. BENNET.\\n\\nOf course my head aches. Your father is so teasing. I cannot persuade\\nhim to call on Mr. Bingley at Netherfield, so I suppose we shall never\\nknow him.\\n\\n\\nJANE.\\n\\n[_Smiling._] But you forget, mamma, that we shall meet him at the\\nassemblies, and Lady Lucas has promised to introduce him.\\n\\n\\nMRS. BENNET.\\n\\nI do not believe Lady Lucas will do any such thing. She has daughters of\\nher own. She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I have no opinion of\\nher.\\n\\n\\nMR. BENNET.\\n\\nNo more have I, and I am glad to find that you do not depend on her\\nserving you.\\n\\n\\nMRS. BENNET.\\n\\nI may have to depend on her after all, Mr. Bennet, since you will do\\nnothing to help me. [_Fretfully to_ LYDIA, _who has been yawning and\\ncoughing._] Don\\'t keep coughing, Lydia, for Heaven\\'s sake! Have a little\\ncompassion on my nerves.\\n\\n[LYDIA _pouts and looks unutterable things._]\\n\\n\\nMR. BENNET.\\n\\nLydia has no discretion in her coughs. She times them ill.\\n\\n\\nLYDIA.\\n\\nI do not cough for my own amusement, papa. Jane, when is your next ball?\\n\\n\\nJANE.\\n\\nTo-morrow fortnight.\\n\\n\\nMRS. BENNET.\\n\\n[_Starting excitedly._] Ay, so it is--and Lady Lucas does not come back\\ntill the day before. So you see it will be impossible for her to\\nintroduce Mr. Bingley, for she will not know him herself.\\n\\n\\nMR. BENNET.\\n\\nThen, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and _you_ can\\nintroduce Mr. Bingley to _her_.\\n\\n\\nMRS. BENNET.\\n\\nImpossible, Mr. Bennet, when I am not acquainted with him myself. How\\ncan you be so teasing?\\n\\n\\nMR. BENNET.\\n\\nI honour your circumspection. A fortnight\\'s acquaintance is certainly\\nvery little. But if _we_ do not venture, somebody else will, and if\\n_you_ decline the office _I_ will take it upon myself.\\n\\n\\nMRS. BENNET.\\n\\n[_As the two girls stare at their father._] Oh, nonsense--nonsense! I am\\nsick of Mr. Bingley!\\n\\n\\nMR. BENNET.\\n\\nI am sorry to hear that; but why did not you tell me so before? If I had\\nknown as much a week ago, I certainly should not have called upon him.\\n\\n\\nMRS. BENNET.\\n\\n[_Springing from her chair and throwing her arms about_ MR. BENNET\\'S\\n_neck._] What! You have really called upon him? Oh, how good in you, my\\ndear Mr. Bennet!\\n\\n\\nMR. BENNET.\\n\\nIt is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit--and as he\\nwill very likely return it at any time, and bring his friend, Mr. Darcy,\\nwith him--we cannot now avoid the acquaintance of Mr. Bingley and his\\nparty.\\n\\n\\nMRS. BENNET.\\n\\nOh, my dear Mr. Bennet, I was sure you loved your girls too well to\\nneglect such an acquaintance. [MR. BENNET _deftly takes her hands from\\nhis shoulders. She stands looking fondly at him._] Well, how pleased I\\nam! And it was such a good joke that you should have already paid Mr.\\nBingley a visit and never said a word about it.\\n\\n\\nMR. BENNET.\\n\\nYes. Yes. Well, I must go to the library. [_He goes to the door, but\\nstops for a moment._] Now, Lydia, you can cough as much as you choose.\\n[_He goes out._]\\n\\n\\nMRS. BENNET.\\n\\n[_Looking after_ MR. BENNET.] What an excellent father you have, girls!\\n[_Turns to the girls._] I do not know how you will ever make him amends\\nfor his kindness, or me either, for that matter. At our time of life it\\nis not so pleasant to be making new acquaintances every day. But for\\nyour sakes we would do anything. [_Looking about her._] Where is Lizzy?\\nLydia, my love, where is your sister?\\n\\n\\nLYDIA.\\n\\nOh, she is out walking with Charlotte Lucas and that dismal Mr. Collins.\\n\\n\\nMRS. BENNET.\\n\\nLizzy--out walking with Mr. Collins? Why didn\\'t _you_ go, Jane?\\n\\n\\nJANE.\\n\\nI had to practise with Lydia.\\n\\n\\nLYDIA.\\n\\nI\\'m sure I would have excused you. But what is Mr. Collins here for,\\nmamma? I am sure I caught Mr. Wickham and Colonel Forster laughing at\\nhim the day we went to Meryton. Why does papa have a cousin like that?\\n\\n\\nMRS. BENNET.\\n\\nHe really cannot help it. It is the entail, my love--[_Mysteriously._]\\nBut I hope that all you girls will be very civil to him, Jane\\nespecially.\\n\\n\\nJANE.\\n\\nI--mamma?\\n\\n\\nMRS. BENNET.\\n\\n[_Embarrassed._] Yes--my love.--You see----\\n\\n[_She is interrupted by the sound of laughter outside, and_ ELIZABETH\\'S\\n_voice._]\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nVery well, Mr. Collins.\\n\\n[MRS. BENNET _makes a sudden awed gesture of silence to the girls, who\\nfail to understand._ ELIZABETH _enters by the glass doors. She is\\ndressed in winter walking costume: a large hat,--fur-trimmed pelerine,\\nand a large muff. She stops in the doorway and looks at_ MRS. BENNET,\\n_half puzzled and smiling._]\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nWell, what is it, mamma? What is the matter?\\n\\n\\nMRS. BENNET.\\n\\nNothing. Hush! What have you done with Mr. Collins?\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\n[_Laughing._] Oh, Mr. Collins is safe! He has gone round to the\\nlibrary.\\n\\n\\nMRS. BENNET.\\n\\n[_With a sigh of relief._] How providential!\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\n[_Looking back._] But I have brought someone else with me.\\n\\n[MR. WICKHAM _and_ CHARLOTTE LUCAS _come in gaily._]\\n\\n\\nALL.\\n\\n[_Exclaiming._] Oh, Mr. Wickham!\\n\\n\\nWICKHAM.\\n\\n[_To_ MRS. BENNET.] How do you do, Mrs. Bennet? This is indeed a\\npleasure. [_Going over to_ JANE.] Miss Bennet, I am _so_ glad to see\\nyou. [_Reproachfully._] You were not with our party! [_To_ LYDIA.] Why\\ndo you never come to Meryton, Miss Lydia? Mr. Denny is quite downcast.\\n\\n\\nLYDIA.\\n\\n[_Pouting._] La, Mr. Denny!\\n\\n\\nWICKHAM.\\n\\nAnd many others beside him, Miss Lydia.\\n\\n[LYDIA _giggles._ WICKHAM _returns to_ MRS. BENNET.]\\n\\n\\nMRS. BENNET.\\n\\nWell, \\'tis an age since we saw you, Mr. Wickham. What _have_ you been\\ndoing?\\n\\n\\nWICKHAM.\\n\\nColonel Forster keeps me so busy that I have no time for enjoyment.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nYes, Mr. Wickham bears all the marks of an harassed and overworked man.\\n\\n\\nWICKHAM.\\n\\n[_Bowing to_ ELIZABETH.] Thank you, Miss Elizabeth. You have given me\\nthe very terms I needed. [_To_ MRS. BENNET.] You see before you, Mrs.\\nBennet, an harassed and overworked man. Miss Elizabeth will bear witness\\nthat I was on my way to a business appointment when I yielded to\\ntemptation and went off for a walk with her and Miss Lucas and their\\nirreproachable escort.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nAnd Miss Elizabeth will also testify that you yielded with the celerity\\nand ease of long practice.\\n\\n\\nWICKHAM.\\n\\n[_Laughing; to_ ELIZABETH.] But in this case who was the tempter?\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nOh, I will admit that Mr. Collins was partially responsible.\\n\\n[_All laugh._]\\n\\n\\nMRS. BENNET.\\n\\nCome, Lizzy, you have been talking to Mr. Wickham all the morning. Now,\\nlet some of the rest of us have a chance. [_Turning to_ WICKHAM.] You\\nmust stay to dinner, Mr. Wickham.\\n\\n\\nWICKHAM.\\n\\nI wish I might. That is indeed a temptation. But you know Miss Elizabeth\\nhas just reminded me of my duty.\\n\\n\\nMRS. BENNET.\\n\\nOh, nobody ever minds Lizzy!\\n\\n\\nWICKHAM.\\n\\nTruly, I cannot to-day, Mrs. Bennet. It is too bad, but I am to meet\\nColonel Forster [_Smiling at_ ELIZABETH] on important _business_ at the\\nDrake Farm.\\n\\n\\nMRS. BENNET.\\n\\nWell, I am very sorry.\\n\\n\\nWICKHAM.\\n\\n[_Hesitatingly._] I might perhaps bring Colonel Forster in for a few\\nmoments on the way back--that is, if we return this way.\\n\\n\\nALL.\\n\\nOh, yes, do.\\n\\n\\nMRS. BENNET.\\n\\nYes, indeed. Tell Colonel Forster we should be delighted to see him.\\n\\n\\nWICKHAM.\\n\\nThank you, I will. But now I really must be gone. [_Bowing brightly to_\\nJANE _and_ LYDIA.] Good morning.\\n\\n[_To_ CHARLOTTE LUCAS.] Good morning, Miss Lucas. You must let me hear\\nmore about those clever plans of yours. I am vastly interested in them.\\n[_To_ ELIZABETH.] Good morning, Miss Elizabeth. [_Laughing._] You must\\ntry to temper your justice with mercy the next time I join you in a\\nwalk. [_Pausing, he looks at_ MRS. BENNET, _who is standing between her\\ndaughters._] Do you know, Mrs. Bennet, that you always remind me of one\\nof my old schoolboy phrases. _Filiæ pulchræ!--Mater pulchrior!_\\nGood-bye.\\n\\n[_He runs off laughing. He has only gone a few steps when_ LYDIA, _who\\nhas been standing close to the door, runs out and calls to him._]\\n\\n\\nLYDIA.\\n\\nOh, Mr. Wickham!\\n\\n[WICKHAM _turns and_ LYDIA _runs up to him and whispers something in his\\near._ WICKHAM _laughs, then shakes his finger at her, still laughing,\\nand goes off._ LYDIA _stops outside and watches him._]\\n\\n\\nJANE.\\n\\nReally, mamma, I think you should speak to Lydia. She is too forward.\\n\\n\\nMRS. BENNET.\\n\\nNonsense! You are jealous.\\n\\n\\nJANE.\\n\\nJealous! Of Lydia?\\n\\n\\nMRS. BENNET.\\n\\nWell, she is no more forward than any of you. All you girls are crazy\\nabout Mr. Wickham. [_Indulgently._] But I can\\'t wonder at it. He\\ncertainly is a most engaging young man. What were those French words he\\nsaid to me as he went out, Lizzy?\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nThey were Latin, dear. He paid a very charming compliment to our pretty\\nmamma. He said--The daughters are lovely, but the mother is lovelier.\\nYou know papa always says that you are handsomer than any of us.\\n\\n\\nMRS. BENNET.\\n\\nMy dear Lizzy, I certainly have had my share of beauty, but I don\\'t\\npretend to be anything extraordinary now. [MR. COLLINS _enters._] Oh,\\nMr. Collins, there you are.\\n\\n\\nMR. COLLINS.\\n\\n[_Bowing profoundly._] I do not find Mr. Bennet in the library, Madam.\\nDo you know where he is?\\n\\n\\nMRS. BENNET.\\n\\nWhy, really, Mr. Collins, I can\\'t imagine. Did you enjoy your walk?\\n\\n\\nMR. COLLINS.\\n\\nMost assuredly, Madam. The beauties of nature, not only in the\\nlandscape, but also [_Bowing to_ ELIZABETH _and_ CHARLOTTE LUCAS.] in\\nthe blooming countenances of my fair companions, made our expedition a\\npeculiarly enjoyable one.\\n\\n\\nMRS. BENNET.\\n\\nWell, I am very glad of it, I am sure. [_To_ JANE _and_ LYDIA.] Girls,\\nwe haven\\'t told Lizzy and Charlotte the news.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nWhat news, mamma?\\n\\n\\nMRS. BENNET.\\n\\n[_Looking at_ CHARLOTTE _with an ill-concealed triumph_.] Oh, nothing of\\nconsequence, Lizzy, only your father has just told us that we may expect\\na visit at any time from our new neighbour, Mr. Bingley, and that friend\\nof his who is stopping with him.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nOh, Mr. Bingley! That will be entertaining. [_Suddenly with mischief she\\nturns to_ MR. COLLINS, _who all through this latter conversation has\\nbeen staring at_ JANE _with solemn persistence_.] Do not you think so,\\nMr. Collins?\\n\\n\\nMR. COLLINS.\\n\\n[_Starting from his absorption._] Eh? What? [_Pompously again._] Excuse\\nme, Miss Elizabeth, on what subject did you ask my opinion?\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nI asked you if you didn\\'t think it was a very pleasant thing to meet new\\nneighbours.\\n\\n\\nMR. COLLINS.\\n\\nMost assuredly, Miss Elizabeth, if those neighbours are possessed of\\nthose qualifications which redound to their own credit, and to the\\nedification of their friends. Otherwise, as a clergyman, I must hesitate\\nin my approval. [_To_ MRS. BENNET.] You realise, I am sure, Madam, the\\ncaution which should ever be exercised where my amiable young cousins\\nare concerned.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nYes, mamma, you really should be cautious.\\n\\n\\nMRS. BENNET.\\n\\nNonsense! Why, my dear Mr. Collins, we have found out all about them.\\nMr. Bingley and Mr. Darcy are connected with some of the most\\nrespectable families in England.\\n\\n\\nMR. COLLINS.\\n\\n[_In amazement._] Mr. Darcy? Mr. Fitzgerald Darcy! My dear Madam, can it\\nbe possible that you are to be honoured by a visit from him? Respectable\\nindeed! Why, he is the nephew of my noble patroness, Lady Catherine de\\nBourg. It is true that I have never yet had the honour of meeting\\nhim--but he frequently visits his aunt, and she has promised to bring\\nhim on some occasion to inspect my humble abode. I am surprised,\\nindeed, by this civility on his part. [_Anxiously._] I only fear there\\nmay be some mistake, for Mr. Darcy has the reputation of possessing a\\nvery natural pride of birth; but if your information is indeed to be\\nrelied upon, I think Lady Catherine would consent to my approval of this\\nvisit, provided my fair cousins will keep in mind the proper attitude of\\nrespectful humility which should be assumed toward a person of his\\nsuperior station.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nWe will promise you, Mr. Collins, never for one instant to forget either\\nMr. Darcy\\'s exalted position or our own insignificance.\\n\\n\\nMR. COLLINS.\\n\\n[_Looking at her with admiration._] With that assurance, Miss Elizabeth,\\nI think even Lady Catherine would be satisfied. So I need no longer\\nwithhold my sanction.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\n[_Curtsying._] We thank you, sir.\\n\\n\\nMR. COLLINS.\\n\\nThis is the very attitude of mind I could desire. [_To_ MRS. BENNET.] I\\nthink, with your permission, I will now retire again to the library.\\n[_Going over smilingly to_ JANE.] There was a volume of Fordyce\\'s\\nsermons that you may remember I was reading to you in this room\\nyesterday. I do not find it in the library. Do you know where it is?\\n[_Looking about him._]\\n\\n\\nJANE.\\n\\nI haven\\'t seen it, Mr. Collins. I will try to find it for you. [_She\\nstarts as if to go out of the room._]\\n\\n\\nMRS. BENNET.\\n\\n[_Wishing to leave them together._] No--no, Lydia will find it. Lydia,\\nmy love, go see if you can find the sermons for Mr. Collins.\\n\\n[LYDIA, _with a grimace, rises slowly from her chair_.]\\n\\n\\nCHARLOTTE LUCAS.\\n\\nOh, Mrs. Bennet, I am quite sure that I saw the book in the hall. I will\\ngo fetch it.\\n\\n\\nMRS. BENNET.\\n\\n[_Sharply._] On no account, Charlotte. Lydia will find the book. Lizzy,\\ngo and get the mud off your shoes.\\n\\n\\nMR. COLLINS.\\n\\nOh, I will not trouble any of you ladies.\\n\\n\\nMRS. BENNET.\\n\\nIt is no trouble, Mr. Collins. Charlotte, if you will come with me, I\\nhave a parcel I should like to send your mother.\\n\\n\\nMR. COLLINS.\\n\\nBut I assure you, Madam----\\n\\n     [_As they go out_, MRS. BENNET--_looking daggers at_\\n     CHARLOTTE--_tries to keep_ MR. COLLINS _with_ JANE.]\\n\\nMRS. BENNET.\\n\\nLydia will find your book, Mr. Collins.\\n\\n\\nMR. COLLINS.\\n\\nOn no account, Madam----\\n\\n     [_With awkward gallantry_ MR. COLLINS _ushers out the\\n     ladies_--LYDIA _rebellious_, CHARLOTTE _somewhat offended_.]\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\n[_With an amused smile, having watched the party vanish, turns to_ JANE\\n_and speaks to her in mock-heroic fashion_.] Miss Bennet! Do you realise\\nthe honour which is so soon to fall upon our humble home, and our\\ngratefully humble selves?\\n\\n\\nJANE.\\n\\n[_Smiling._] Oh, Lizzy!\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nDo you really grasp in its full significance the fact that we may soon\\nbe honoured by a visit from Mr. Bingley of Netherfield and Mr.\\nFitzgerald Darcy, nephew of the Lady Catherine de Bourg?\\n\\n\\nJANE.\\n\\nOh, Lizzy, Mr. Collins is a little pompous, but he seems a very\\nwell-meaning young man--indeed, sometimes quite agreeable.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\n[_Looking quizzically, but affectionately, at her sister._] No one can\\nbe anything but agreeable in the mind of our dear Jane. This time,\\nhowever, I quite agree with you, I am as delighted as papa with Mr.\\nCollins. I can see that his mixture of servility and importance promises\\nwell.\\n\\n\\nJANE.\\n\\nAnd I think Mr. Bingley and Mr. Darcy promise well. If the half of what\\nour neighbours say is true, Mr. Bingley will give us all sorts of\\ngaieties. [_Slyly._] Who knows? We may find him as entertaining as Mr.\\nWickham.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nAs Mr. Wickham? Then, dear Jane, we shall be rich indeed. [_Counting on\\nher fingers._] For hospitality--Mr. Bingley; for conversation--Mr.\\nWickham; for grandeur--Mr. Darcy, and the agreeable Mr. Collins!\\n\\n\\nJANE.\\n\\nOh, Lizzy! Can not you let the poor man alone?\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nWith all my heart. I will gladly let him alone. You shall have him all\\nto yourself. [_Mischievously._] If only Mr. Collins knew your good\\nopinion of him! But he is too modest to find it out for himself.\\n\\n\\nJANE.\\n\\n[_Playfully pulling_ ELIZABETH\\'S _ear_.] You are a tease!\\n\\n\\nHARRIS.\\n\\n[_Entering._] The two gentlemen from Netherfield have just brought their\\nhorses into the paddock, Madam.\\n\\n\\nJANE.\\n\\nShow them in, Harris, and speak to Mrs. Bennet at once.\\n\\n[HARRIS _bows and goes out_.]\\n\\n\\nJANE.\\n\\nThey have come soon, Lizzy. Really this is very civil in them.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nUncommonly civil. Come with me, Jane. I must make myself tidy. Mud and\\ndirty petticoats for Mr. Darcy!--Oh, that would never do.\\n\\n     [_They run off, laughing. There is a short pause. Then_ MR. BINGLEY\\n     _and_ MR. DARCY _enter. The latter is very quiet, with an air of\\n     scornful hauteur_. BINGLEY, _on the contrary, has a gracious and\\n     animated manner_. HARRIS _ushers them in, much impressed_.]\\n\\nBINGLEY.\\n\\n[_To_ HARRIS.] You will announce us to Mr. Bennet and the ladies.\\n\\n[HARRIS _goes out_.]\\n\\nDo you know, Darcy, I believe that was George Wickham we saw just now,\\ngoing toward the Drake Farm.\\n\\n\\nDARCY.\\n\\n[_Quietly._] I think there is no doubt of it.\\n\\n\\nBINGLEY.\\n\\nBut what is he doing here?\\n\\n\\nDARCY.\\n\\n[_With assumed indifference._] Probably it is his regiment which is\\nstationed at Meryton.\\n\\n\\nBINGLEY.\\n\\n[_Excitedly._] No, Darcy! You don\\'t mean it! Why, confound it, if I had\\nhad any notion of that--I ... I....\\n\\n\\nDARCY.\\n\\n[_Contemptuously._] I don\\'t think we need mind Wickham.\\n\\n\\nBINGLEY.\\n\\nBut I do mind! To think that I should bring you into the neighbourhood\\nof that rascal----\\n\\nDARCY.\\n\\nHe must live somewhere, I suppose.\\n\\n\\nBINGLEY.\\n\\nYes, unfortunately. But, Darcy, you are a puzzle to me.--You are,\\nindeed! How can you speak with any charity of a man who for years abused\\nthe patience and generous kindness of your father, and who so lately has\\nattempted against your family the most dastardly action that----\\n\\nDARCY.\\n\\n[_Interrupting him with hauteur._] We have already said too much of\\nGeorge Wickham. I prefer not to discuss him further.\\n\\n     [BINGLEY _turns away hurt and embarrassed_. DARCY _seeing the\\n     effect of his words and manner, goes to him kindly, and speaks to\\n     him in a changed voice_.]\\n\\nBingley, I entirely understand your indignation. Indeed, I share it so\\nfully that I dare not trust myself to think of the man\\'s villainy. It is\\nbetter that I say nothing of him, even to you.\\n\\n\\nBINGLEY.\\n\\n[_Moved._] I am sure, I beg your pardon, Darcy.\\n\\n\\nDARCY.\\n\\nIt is rather for me to ask yours.\\n\\n     [_There follows an awkward pause, which BINGLEY at length breaks by\\n     speaking in a tone of forced gaiety_.]\\n\\nBINGLEY.\\n\\nPretty place, this.\\n\\n\\nDARCY.\\n\\n[_With a shrug._] Very small.\\n\\n\\nBINGLEY.\\n\\nWhat has the size to do with it? I think we are in luck to have such\\ncharming neighbours. You know we saw two of the young ladies going\\nthrough the lane the other day. Why, Darcy, one of them is the most\\nbeautiful creature I ever beheld--and the other--the one with the dark\\neyes--she is uncommonly pretty. Don\\'t you think so?\\n\\n\\nDARCY.\\n\\nShe is tolerable, but fine eyes cannot change family connections.\\n\\n\\nBINGLEY.\\n\\n[_Quickly._] What do you mean?\\n\\n\\nDARCY.\\n\\nI think I have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in\\nMeryton.\\n\\n\\nBINGLEY.\\n\\n[_Shortly._] Yes.\\n\\n\\nDARCY.\\n\\nAnd that they have another in London who lives somewhere near Cheapside.\\n\\n\\nBINGLEY.\\n\\n[_With irritation._] If they had uncles enough to fill all Cheapside, it\\nwouldn\\'t make them one jot less handsome.\\n\\n\\nDARCY.\\n\\nBut it must materially lessen their chances of marrying men of any\\nconsideration in the world.\\n\\n\\nBINGLEY.\\n\\nOf marrying? You go fast, Darcy.\\n\\n\\nDARCY.\\n\\nPerhaps. But I am in no humour to give consequence to young ladies. I am\\nhere to please you, Bingley--and--[_He smiles meaningly._] knowing your\\ndisposition, I think it is just as well that I came.\\n\\n     [BINGLEY _is about to reply when the door opens and_ MRS. BENNET\\n     _enters, followed by_ JANE _and_ ELIZABETH. _The two young men\\n     make ceremonious bows._ MRS. BENNET _curtsies and then advances\\n     with delighted fussiness_.]\\n\\n\\nMRS. BENNET.\\n\\nGood morning, gentlemen. I am so sorry that Mr. Bennet has gone for his\\nwalk.\\n\\n     [_As she looks a little puzzled from one to the other_, BINGLEY\\n     _advances_.]\\n\\nBINGLEY.\\n\\nGood morning, Mrs. Bennet. I am Mr. Bingley, your new neighbour at\\nNetherfield. This is my friend, Mr. Darcy, of Pendleton, Derbyshire.\\n[_All bow and curtsy._] Mr. Bennet has been so kind as to call upon us,\\nand we are most happy to have the honour of waiting upon the ladies of\\nhis family.\\n\\n\\nMRS. BENNET.\\n\\nWe are delighted to see you, I am sure! Mr. Bingley--Mr.\\nDarcy--[_Indicating_ JANE]--my eldest daughter, Miss Bennet.\\n[_Indicating_ ELIZABETH]--Miss Elizabeth Bennet.\\n\\n[_The girls make low curtsies--the gentlemen bow._]\\n\\nWill not you be seated, gentlemen? [_The guests and ladies seat\\nthemselves._] I am sure you must like Netherfield, Mr. Bingley. I do not\\nknow a place in the country that is equal to Netherfield. You will not\\nthink of quitting it in a hurry, I hope, though you have but a short\\nlease.\\n\\n\\nBINGLEY.\\n\\nWhatever I do is done in a hurry, Mrs. Bennet, and therefore if I should\\nresolve to quit Netherfield I should probably be off in five minutes. At\\npresent, however, [_looking intently at_ JANE] I consider myself as\\nquite fixed here.\\n\\n\\nJANE.\\n\\nIt is very pleasant to have Netherfield open once more, although you\\nmust both miss London. There is so much gaiety in London.\\n\\n\\nDARCY.\\n\\nYes, in a country neighbourhood you move in a confined and unvarying\\nsociety.\\n\\n[MRS. BENNET _looks vexed at this speech_.]\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nBut people themselves alter so much that there is something new to be\\nobserved in them forever.\\n\\n[DARCY _turns and looks at_ ELIZABETH _with surprise and interest_.]\\n\\n\\nBINGLEY.\\n\\nThen you are a student of character, Miss Elizabeth. It must be an\\namusing study.\\n\\n\\nMRS. BENNET.\\n\\nYes, Lizzy always likes to watch people. [_Looking at_ DARCY.] And there\\nare plenty of people about, even if you do live in the country. The\\ncountry is a vast deal pleasanter than London, is not it, Mr. Bingley?\\n\\n\\nBINGLEY.\\n\\nWhen I am in the country I never wish to leave it, and when I am in town\\nit is pretty much the same. They have each their advantages and I am\\nequally happy in either.\\n\\n\\nMRS. BENNET.\\n\\nAy--that is because _you_ have the right disposition. [_Looking at_\\nDARCY.] But that gentleman seemed to think the country was nothing at\\nall.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\n[_Quickly._] Indeed, mamma, you are mistaken. You quite mistook Mr.\\nDarcy. He only meant that there is not such a variety of people to be\\nmet with in the country as in town, which you must acknowledge to be\\ntrue.\\n\\n\\nMRS. BENNET.\\n\\nCertainly, my dear, nobody said there was--but as to not meeting with\\nmany people in this neighbourhood, I believe there are few\\nneighbourhoods larger. I know we dine with four-and-twenty families.\\n\\n     [_As all become embarrassed at this speech_, BINGLEY _comes to the\\n     rescue_.]\\n\\nBINGLEY.\\n\\nYes, there are many fine estates hereabout. Can you see Sir William\\nLucas\\' place from the garden? I am not quite sure I have placed it.\\n\\n\\nMRS. BENNET.\\n\\nOh, yes, there is a fine view of the chimneys from the terrace. Sir\\nWilliam is our nearest neighbour. Such an agreeable man--so genteel, and\\nso easy---- [_Rising, she goes toward the glass doors._] Come, Jane, we\\nmust show Mr. Bingley Sir William\\'s chimneys.\\n\\n     [MRS. BENNET, BINGLEY, _and_ JANE _go out upon the terrace_.]\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\n[_Smiling mischievously._] Would not you also like to see the chimneys,\\nMr. Darcy?\\n\\n\\nDARCY.\\n\\nThank you. Like yourself, I prefer people to places.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nDid I say that?\\n\\n\\nDARCY.\\n\\nNot precisely. But I have drawn that conclusion.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\n[_Gathering her sewing materials, begins to embroider._] Well, I can\\nlaugh at people better than places, and I dearly love a laugh.\\n\\n\\nDARCY.\\n\\nIsn\\'t that rather a dangerous trait, Miss Bennet? The wisest and the\\nbest of men may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in\\nlife is a joke.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nCertainly. But I hope I never ridicule what is wise or good. Whims and\\ninconsistencies do divert me, I own, and I laugh at them whenever I can.\\n[_Mischievously._] But these, I suppose, are precisely what you are\\nwithout.\\n\\n\\nDARCY.\\n\\nPerhaps that is not possible for anyone. But it has been the study of my\\nlife to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong understanding\\nto ridicule.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nAnd in your list of weaknesses do you include such faults as vanity and\\npride, for instance?\\n\\n\\nDARCY.\\n\\nYes, vanity is a weakness, indeed, but _pride_, where there is a real\\nsuperiority of mind--pride will be always under good regulation.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nI am perfectly convinced, Mr. Darcy, that you have no defect.\\n\\n\\nDARCY.\\n\\nI have made no such pretension, Miss Bennet. I have faults enough. My\\ntemper I dare not vouch for. I cannot forget the follies and vices of\\nothers against myself. My good opinion once lost is lost forever.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nThat is a failing, indeed. Implacable resentment _is_ a shade in a\\ncharacter. But you have chosen your fault well. I really cannot laugh at\\nit. You are safe from me.\\n\\n\\nDARCY.\\n\\nThere is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some particular\\nevil--a natural defect which not even the best education can overcome.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nAnd your defect is a propensity to hate everybody.\\n\\n\\nDARCY.\\n\\n[_Smiling._] And yours to wilfully misunderstand them.\\n\\n     [_Voices are heard outside._ ELIZABETH _applies herself to her\\n     embroidery_. BINGLEY, JANE, _and_ MRS. BENNET _return from the\\n     terrace_.]\\n\\nBINGLEY.\\n\\nThe surrounding country is really charming, Mrs. Bennet.\\n\\n\\nMRS. BENNET.\\n\\n_We_ think so. But you must give us a ball at Netherfield, Mr. Bingley,\\nand then you will see that some of the people who live here are worth\\nknowing.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\n[_Distressed._] Oh, mamma!\\n\\n\\nJANE.\\n\\nMamma!\\n\\n\\nBINGLEY.\\n\\nCertainly, Mrs. Bennet. I had already decided upon it. I told Mr. Darcy\\nonly yesterday that as soon as my sister, Miss Bingley, arrived, and\\nNicholas could make white soup enough, I should send out my cards. Did\\nnot I, Darcy?\\n\\n\\nDARCY.\\n\\n[_Very stiffly._] I believe you did.\\n\\n\\nMRS. BENNET.\\n\\nWell, that is vastly good in you, Mr. Bingley; and then, perhaps, your\\nfriend may change his mind about the country. [_To_ DARCY.] You didn\\'t\\ncome to admire Sir William\\'s chimneys, Mr. Darcy.\\n\\n\\nDARCY.\\n\\nI was admiring your daughter\\'s work, Madam.\\n\\n\\nMRS. BENNET.\\n\\nOh, you should see Jane\\'s work. Lizzy is all for books, like her father.\\nShe is a great reader and has no pleasure in anything else. Jane, show\\nyour embroidered parrot to Mr. Bingley.\\n\\n\\nJANE.\\n\\nI do not think Mr. Bingley would be interested, ma\\'am.\\n\\n\\nBINGLEY.\\n\\n[_Eagerly._] Oh, indeed, I should, Miss Bennet; I am very much\\ninterested in parrots.--Pray show it to me.\\n\\n\\nMRS. BENNET.\\n\\nYes, and the new hand-screen. I will find it for you.\\n\\n     [_All three withdraw, leaving_ ELIZABETH _and_ DARCY _together_.]\\n\\nDARCY.\\n\\nAnd so you are a great reader and take no pleasure in anything else?\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nMamma does not understand. I deserve neither such praise nor such\\ncensure. I am _not_ a great reader, and I have pleasure in many things.\\n\\n\\nDARCY.\\n\\nSo I should have thought.\\n\\n\\nBINGLEY.\\n\\n[_Looking at the screen which he holds in his hand._]\\n\\nIt is amazing to me how young ladies can have patience to be so very\\naccomplished as they are; to think how you all paint tables and cover\\nscreens and net purses. It is quite wonderful.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nDo you agree with your friend, Mr. Darcy?\\n\\n\\nDARCY.\\n\\nHis list of the common extent of accomplishments has too much truth. But\\nI cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen young ladies in the\\nwhole range of my acquaintance that are really accomplished.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nThen you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished\\nwoman.\\n\\n\\nDARCY.\\n\\nPerhaps. To deserve the word, a woman must have a thorough knowledge of\\nmusic, singing, drawing, dancing, and the modern languages. She must\\nalso possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking--the\\ntone of her voice--her address and expression, and to all this she must\\nyet add something more substantial--[_With a little bow to_ ELIZABETH.]\\nin the improvement of her mind by extensive reading.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\n[_Laughing._] I am no longer surprised at your knowing only six\\naccomplished women! I rather wonder at your knowing any.\\n\\n\\nHARRIS.\\n\\n[_Enters and announces._] Colonel Forster and Mr. Wickham.\\n\\n[_The gentlemen enter, smiling._]\\n\\n\\nWICKHAM.\\n\\nHere I am again, Mrs. Bennet. I found that Colonel Forster had a message\\nfor the young ladies.\\n\\n\\nMRS. BENNET.\\n\\nI am delighted to see you. You are just in time to meet our new\\nneighbours. [_Introducing the gentlemen._] Colonel Forster, Mr.\\nWickham--Mr. Bingley, Mr. Darcy.\\n\\n     [_As the gentlemen enter_, MR. DARCY _has his back turned to them\\n     in conversation with_ ELIZABETH. _At the sound of_ WICKHAM\\'S _voice\\n     he starts and turns so that he faces the latter just in time for\\n     the introduction. At sight of_ DARCY, WICKHAM _starts and is\\n     greatly confused_. DARCY _stiffens and scarcely nods when_ WICKHAM\\n     _is introduced. The whole situation is so marked that everyone\\n     looks on with an astonishment to which_ MRS. BENNET _gives audible\\n     expression_.]\\n\\nMRS. BENNET.\\n\\nWell, well! If ever there was a proud, stiff man----\\n\\nJANE.\\n\\n[_In a dismayed whisper._] Mamma!\\n\\n\\nBINGLEY.\\n\\n[_Looking distressed, speaks hurriedly._] Oh, Mrs. Bennet, I\\'m sorry\\nthat we cannot wait for Mr. Bennet. We--we--were on the way to meet my\\nsteward--and we are already late for the appointment.\\n\\n\\nMRS. BENNET.\\n\\n[_Effusively._] I am very sorry you must go, Mr. Bingley. But I hope you\\nwill come again. We must engage you soon for dinner.\\n\\n\\nBINGLEY.\\n\\n[_In an absent and worried way._] It will be a pleasure.\\n\\n[_Then with bows, the party moves toward the door._]\\n\\n\\nMRS. BENNET.\\n\\n[_Bustling._] Your best way to the paddock is by the terrace.\\n\\n     [_The gentlemen have almost reached the glass doors when_ MR.\\n     COLLINS _comes in excitedly, putting himself directly in the way\\n     of_ BINGLEY _and_ DARCY.]\\n\\nMR. COLLINS.\\n\\nMy dear Miss Elizabeth, I have this moment found out by a singular\\naccident that there is now in this room a near relation of my patroness\\nLady Catherine de Bourg. Will you present me?\\n\\n     [_He looks enquiringly from one to the other of the young men._]\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nMr. Bingley, allow me to present my cousin, Mr. Collins--Mr. Darcy--Mr.\\nCollins.\\n\\n\\nMR. COLLINS.\\n\\n[_Taking almost no notice of_ MR. BINGLEY, _he greets_ MR. DARCY _with\\nservile effusion_.] My dear sir--I trust you will pardon me for not\\nhaving paid my respects before. My total ignorance of your presence here\\nmust plead my apology. [_Looking severely about him at the ladies._] I\\nwas not informed of it. Is there any message, sir, which I could take\\nfrom you to my honoured patroness--your aunt, or to your fair\\ncousin--Miss de Bourg?\\n\\n\\nDARCY.\\n\\n[_Stiffly._] Thank you, I will not trouble you so far.\\n\\n\\nMR. COLLINS.\\n\\nIt would be no trouble--but an honour and a privilege.\\n\\n\\nDARCY.\\n\\n[_Disgusted, turns from him to_ BINGLEY.] We are already very late,\\nBingley.\\n\\n\\nBINGLEY.\\n\\nYes,--we have no time to lose.\\n\\n     [DARCY _and_ BINGLEY _give passing bows and go out by the glass\\n     doors_. MR. COLLINS _keeps by_ DARCY\\'S _side and, as they pass out\\n     of sight, is seen still talking to him, to his evident annoyance.\\n     All the time that the party is bidding good-bye to_ BINGLEY _and_\\n     DARCY, WICKHAM _has been moodily standing by the fireplace_.\\n     ELIZABETH _has evidently been concerned about him, for throughout\\n     the foregoing interview with_ MR. COLLINS, _she has looked at_\\n     WICKHAM _from time to time_.]\\n\\nHILL.\\n\\n[_Enters at the door leading to the hall._] May I speak to you, Madam?\\n\\n\\nMRS. BENNET.\\n\\nYes, Hill, yes. [_To the gentlemen._] Excuse me for a moment. I will\\nreturn directly. [MRS. BENNET _and_ HILL _go out_.]\\n\\n\\nCOLONEL FORSTER.\\n\\nOh, Miss Bennet, Miss Elizabeth! Your aunt, Mrs. Phillips, has sent word\\nby me that her card-party is to be on Wednesday. She hopes you will\\nsurely be there.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\n[_In a pre-occupied way, looking towards_ WICKHAM.] Oh, yes, we shall\\ngo.\\n\\n\\nCOLONEL FORSTER.\\n\\n[_As he passes the piano, and looking at some music which is on the\\nrack._] Ah! Here is the song you have promised to sing to me. Pray sing\\nit now, Miss Elizabeth.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nReally, Colonel Forster, you must excuse me for to-day. Jane will play\\nfor you, instead.\\n\\n\\nJANE.\\n\\nIndeed, I cannot, Lizzy.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\n[_Looking meaningly at her._] _Please_, Jane.\\n\\n\\nCOLONEL FORSTER.\\n\\nOh, do, I beg--Miss Bennet.\\n\\n     [_All through the following interview between_ ELIZABETH _and_\\n     WICKHAM, _the tinkle of the instrument is heard. During their\\n     conversation_ JANE\\'S _back is_ _turned--also_ COLONEL FORSTER\\'S _as\\n     he looks over her music--so that_ ELIZABETH _and_ WICKHAM _are\\n     practically alone_. ELIZABETH _returns to her embroidery. There is\\n     an awkward pause for a moment._ WICKHAM _finally breaks it_.]\\n\\nWICKHAM.\\n\\nHow long has Mr. Darcy been in Hertfordshire, Miss Elizabeth?\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nOnly for a very short time, I believe. He comes from Derbyshire, I\\nunderstand, and has a very large property there.\\n\\n\\nWICKHAM.\\n\\nYes, his estate is a noble one. A clear ten thousand per annum. I am\\nwell informed on this head---- [_Hesitates._] I have been connected with\\nMr. Darcy\\'s family in a particular manner since my infancy.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\n[_Surprised._] Indeed?\\n\\n\\nWICKHAM.\\n\\nYou may well be surprised, Miss Elizabeth, at this assertion after\\nseeing the very cold manner of our meeting just now. [_After a pause._]\\nAre you much acquainted with Mr. Darcy?\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nNo. Though I have heard of him, I met him for the first time to-day, but\\neven on this short acquaintance I should take him to be an ill-tempered\\nman.\\n\\n\\nWICKHAM.\\n\\n[_As if he had come to a sudden decision._] Miss Elizabeth, you have\\nbeen a witness of Mr. Darcy\\'s treatment of me to-day, and therefore I\\nfeel that I must, for my own justification, acquaint you with the facts\\nof my past connection with him.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nI shall respect your confidence, Mr. Wickham.\\n\\n\\nWICKHAM.\\n\\nI am sure of it. [_After a short pause._] Mr. Darcy and I were born in\\nthe same parish. My own father, who, to be frank, was steward of the\\nDarcy estates, gave up everything to serve the interests of the Darcy\\nfamily. Mr. Darcy\\'s father was excessively attached to me:--indeed, I\\nwas his godson. He meant to provide for me amply, and thought he had\\ndone so. I was destined for the church and Mr. Darcy\\'s father left to me\\na most valuable living. But the present Mr. Darcy chose to ignore his\\nfather\\'s will and gave the living to another man. This closed for me the\\ncareer for which I was most fitted and left me with almost no means of\\nsupport.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nGood heavens! But how could that be? Why did not you seek legal redress?\\n\\n\\nWICKHAM.\\n\\nThere was an informality in the terms of the will which gave me no hope\\nfrom the law. Mr. Darcy\\'s father had relied implicitly upon the honour\\nof his son.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nBut--this is quite shocking. Mr. Darcy deserves to be publicly\\ndisgraced!\\n\\n\\nWICKHAM.\\n\\nSometime or other he will be, but not by me. Till I can forget his\\nfather, I can never defy or expose him.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nThis feeling does you honour. But what can have induced Mr. Darcy to\\nbehave so cruelly?\\n\\n\\nWICKHAM.\\n\\nI must attribute it in some measure to his jealousy. His father\\'s\\nuncommon attachment to me irritated him, but the fact is, Miss\\nElizabeth, as you can see, we are very different men, and he hates me.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nHis disposition must be dreadful.\\n\\n\\nWICKHAM.\\n\\nI will not trust myself on that subject.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nTo treat in such a manner the godson--the friend--the favourite of his\\nfather! How abominable!\\n\\n\\nWICKHAM.\\n\\nAnd yet, Miss Elizabeth, we must try to be just to him. Mr. Darcy has\\nmany good qualities. He can be both liberal and generous. He has also a\\nbrother\\'s affection and pride which makes him a careful guardian of his\\nsister.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nOh, he has a sister?\\n\\n\\nWICKHAM.\\n\\nYes. You will hear him cried up as the most attentive and best of\\nbrothers. Oh, Mr. Darcy can please when he chooses. Among those who are\\nhis equals he is a very different man from what he is to the less\\nprosperous.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nContemptible!\\n\\n\\nCOLONEL FORSTER.\\n\\n[_Interrupting._] Wickham!\\n\\n\\nWICKHAM.\\n\\n[_Starting._] Yes, Colonel Forster.\\n\\n\\nCOLONEL FORSTER.\\n\\nI fear we must be going.\\n\\n\\nWICKHAM.\\n\\n[_Hurriedly to Elizabeth._] Thank you for listening to me. It is hard to\\nbe misjudged.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nThank you for your confidence. It is well to know the truth.\\n\\n\\nCOLONEL FORSTER.\\n\\nWell, Miss Elizabeth, I hope we shall see you all at your aunt\\'s on\\nWednesday. Good morning. [_To_ JANE.] Good morning, Miss Bennet. Thank\\nyou for the music. Please present my respects to Mrs. Bennet. I am sorry\\nthat we cannot wait longer.\\n\\n\\nWICKHAM.\\n\\n[_Effusively._] Yes, Miss Bennet, be sure to give your mother my best\\nregards. Good morning--[_All bow and curtsy. As he is leaving he speaks\\naside._] Oh, Miss Elizabeth, may I entreat----\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nYou may depend upon my sympathy.\\n\\n\\nWICKHAM.\\n\\n[_Looking at her with an understanding smile._] I am most grateful.\\n\\n     [_The gentlemen go out of the door._ JANE _and_ ELIZABETH _go into\\n     the recess and look from the window. There is a short pause._]\\n\\nMRS. BENNET.\\n\\n[_Enters, flurried, and looks about her._] Well, have they gone?\\n\\n     [MR. COLLINS _enters through the glass doors at the center. He\\n     sees_ MRS. BENNET.]\\n\\nMR. COLLINS.\\n\\nOh, Madam, I am just returned from attending on Mr. Darcy. Such a\\nprivilege! He was most condescending. I was able to tell him that Lady\\nCatherine was very well on Saturday sennight. He is very like Lady\\nCatherine. I am sure you must have been impressed by his distinguished\\nmanners.\\n\\n\\nMRS. BENNET.\\n\\nWell, really, Mr. Collins!\\n\\n     [_A titter is heard from the recess where the girls are seated, and\\n     then_ JANE\\'S _voice_.]\\n\\nJANE.\\n\\nOh, Lizzy, hush!\\n\\n\\nMR. COLLINS.\\n\\n[_Hearing this, turns and discovers the two girls. Then he speaks to_\\nMRS. BENNET _with lowered voice, as if an idea had just come to him_.]\\nThis meeting is most opportune. Will you kindly step this way for a\\nmoment? [_He draws_ MRS. BENNET _aside_.] May I hope, Madam, for your\\ninterest with your fair daughter Jane, in the matter on which we were\\nspeaking yesterday? I would solicit the honour of a private audience\\nwith her this morning.\\n\\n\\nMRS. BENNET.\\n\\nCertainly, Mr. Collins. [_Hesitating._] But there have been some changes\\nsince then. Some things have happened--I think it is right you should\\nknow, that--that Jane is very likely to be soon engaged.\\n[_Encouragingly._] But there is Elizabeth. I cannot take it upon myself\\nto say--I cannot possibly answer--but I do not know of any prepossession\\nin her case, and I am sure she can have no objection to listen to you.\\n\\n[MRS. BENNET _goes to the fire and stirs it_.]\\n\\n\\nMR. COLLINS.\\n\\n[_As soon as she has finished._] Then Miss Elizabeth let it be, Madam. I\\nwas struck by her attitude of respectful awe when I mentioned the Lady\\nCatherine de Bourg. Such modesty and humility of mind cannot but\\nrecommend her to my patroness.\\n\\n\\nMRS. BENNET.\\n\\n[_Looking rather astonished at this last speech, but recovering\\nherself._] Yes, my daughter Elizabeth knows what is proper. She will be\\nvery happy to listen to you. Shall I call her now?\\n\\n\\nMR. COLLINS.\\n\\nI think, Madam, there should be no further loss of time, as my leave of\\nabsence extends only to the coming Saturday.\\n\\n\\nMRS. BENNET.\\n\\nVery well--[_She goes to the recess where the two girls are talking\\ntogether._] Jane, I want you upstairs. Lizzy, Mr. Collins has something\\nhe wishes to say to you.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\n[_Suspicious and dismayed._] Dear ma\\'am, Mr. Collins must excuse me. I\\nwas just going away myself.\\n\\n\\nMRS. BENNET.\\n\\nNow, no nonsense, Lizzy! I desire you will stay. Mr. Collins has\\nsomething _very_ particular to say to you. [_As_ ELIZABETH _tries to\\nescape_.] Lizzy, I insist upon your staying and hearing Mr. Collins.\\nCome, Jane--[MRS. BENNET _and_ JANE _go out_.]\\n\\n\\nMR. COLLINS.\\n\\n[_Approaching_ ELIZABETH, _who does not move from the place where her\\nmother left her_.] Believe me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, your modesty so\\nfar from doing you any disservice rather adds to your other perfections.\\nBut allow me to assure you that I have your respected mother\\'s\\npermission for this address. [_He escorts_ ELIZABETH _with clumsy\\ngallantry to the sofa, then brings a chair and seats himself opposite to\\nher_. ELIZABETH _has recovered herself sufficiently to begin to enjoy\\nthe humour of the situation_.] My fair cousin, you must have at least\\nsurmised that I am about to ask you to become the companion of my life.\\nAnd perhaps I had better begin by stating my reasons for this decision\\nbefore I am run away with by my feelings on this subject. [ELIZABETH _is\\nso overcome with laughter at this idea that she can hardly speak, or\\nkeep a decent countenance_.]\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nOh, I beg, Mr. Collins----\\n\\nMR. COLLINS.\\n\\nOne moment. My reasons for marrying are, first,--that I think it a right\\nthing for every clergyman to set the example of matrimony to his parish;\\nsecond, I am convinced it will add very greatly to my happiness; third,\\nit is the particular advice of that very noble lady whom I have the\\nhonour of calling patroness.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\n[_With more command of her voice._] Believe me, Mr. Collins----\\n\\nMR. COLLINS.\\n\\nExcuse me--one moment. It remains only to be told why my views were\\ndirected to Longbourn instead of to my own neighbourhood. The fact is\\nthat, being as I am to inherit this estate after the death of your\\nfather (who, however, may live many years longer), I could not satisfy\\nmyself without resolving to choose a wife from among his daughters, that\\nthe loss to them might be as little as possible, when the melancholy\\nevent took place. This has been my motive, my fair cousin, and I flatter\\nmyself it will not sink me in your esteem.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nMr. Collins,--I----\\n\\nMR. COLLINS.\\n\\n[_Rising and approaching nearer to_ ELIZABETH.] Still one moment more!\\nAnd now nothing remains for me but to assure you, in the most animated\\nlanguage, of the violence of my affection. To fortune I am perfectly\\nindifferent, and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach on\\nthat score shall ever pass my lips when we are married.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\n[_Rising in her turn._] You are too hasty, sir! You forget that I have\\nmade no answer. Accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me. I\\nam very sensible of the honour of your proposals, but it is impossible\\nfor me to do otherwise than decline them.\\n\\n\\nMR. COLLINS.\\n\\n[_With another formal wave of the hand._] I am not unmindful of the fact\\nthat sometimes a young lady\\'s refusal is repeated a second or even a\\nthird time. I am, therefore, by no means discouraged by what you have\\njust said, and I shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nUpon my word, sir, your hope is rather an extraordinary one after my\\ndeclaration! You must pay me the compliment of believing what I say. I\\nwish you very happy, and very rich, and, by refusing your hand, do all\\nin my power to prevent your being otherwise. This matter may be\\nconsidered, therefore, as definitely settled.\\n\\n     [_She is about to leave the room when_ MR. COLLINS _detains her_.]\\n\\nMR. COLLINS.\\n\\nOne moment. When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this\\nsubject, I shall hope to receive a more favourable answer.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\n[_Becoming angry._] Really, Mr. Collins, you puzzle me exceedingly. I\\nknow not how to express my refusal in such a way as may convince you of\\nits being one.\\n\\n\\nMR. COLLINS.\\n\\nYou must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that your\\nrefusals of my address are merely words, of course. I shall choose to\\nattribute them to your wish of increasing my love by suspense, according\\nto the usual practice of elegant females.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\n[_Very decidedly._] Please do not consider me now as an \\'elegant\\nfemale\\'; I would rather be paid the compliment of being believed\\nsincere. To accept your proposal is absolutely impossible. Can I speak\\nplainer?\\n\\n\\nMR. COLLINS.\\n\\n[_With awkward gallantry._] You are uniformly charming; but I am\\npersuaded that when my proposals are sanctioned by both your parents\\nthey will not fail of being acceptable. Meanwhile I may perhaps best\\nserve my cause by leaving you to consider the matter by yourself for a\\nwhile.\\n\\n     [_He bows and withdraws to the door._ ELIZABETH _with a gesture as\\n     if she gave the whole matter up in despair, and yet half amused,\\n     goes to the fireplace. Just as_ MR. COLLINS _reaches the door_ MRS.\\n     BENNET _opens it_.]\\n\\nMRS. BENNET.\\n\\nWell, Mr. Collins, are we to congratulate each other? [_Looking\\ndoubtfully at_ ELIZABETH.] Has all gone as you could wish?\\n\\n\\nMR. COLLINS.\\n\\nI have every reason to be satisfied, Madam. My cousin has indeed\\nsteadily refused this, my first offer, and with considerable warmth, but\\nthis refusal would naturally flow from her bashful modesty. With your\\ninfluence behind me, I have no doubt of my ultimate success.\\n\\n\\nMRS. BENNET.\\n\\nYes, you may depend upon me, Mr. Collins. I will speak to Lizzy myself\\ndirectly. She is a very headstrong, foolish girl and does not know her\\nown interest. But I will make her know it.\\n\\n\\nMR. COLLINS.\\n\\n[_Alarmed._] Pardon me, Madam, but if she is really headstrong and\\nfoolish, I know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable\\nwife to a man in my situation. If, therefore, Miss Elizabeth persists in\\nrejecting my suit, perhaps it were better not to force her into\\naccepting me.\\n\\n\\nMRS. BENNET.\\n\\n[_Alarmed in her turn._] Sir, you quite misunderstand me. Lizzy is only\\nheadstrong in such matters as these. In everything else she is as\\ngood-natured a girl as ever lived. Let me see her alone for a moment.\\nThat will be the best.\\n\\n\\nMR. COLLINS.\\n\\nBut Madam--I----\\n\\nMRS. BENNET.\\n\\n[_Almost forcing_ MR. COLLINS _out of the room_.] Oh, I shall very soon\\nsettle it with her, I am sure. [MR. COLLINS _goes out_. MRS. BENNET\\n_goes quickly to_ ELIZABETH.] Lizzy, what is the meaning of all this?\\nHave you refused Mr. Collins?\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nYes, mamma, but please listen----\\n\\nMRS. BENNET.\\n\\n[_Angrily._] No, I will not listen. I tell you what, Miss Lizzy, if you\\ntake it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this\\nway, you will never get a husband at all. I am going at once to the\\nlibrary and speak to your father. You will listen _to him_ perhaps.\\n\\n     [MRS. BENNET _starts to go when she sees_ MR. BENNET _outside\\n     passing the glass doors. He is just returning from his walk and\\n     carries a book under his arm_.]\\n\\nMRS. BENNET.\\n\\nOh, there he is now! [_She runs to the door, and opens it._] Oh, Mr.\\nBennet--Mr. Bennet! [MR. BENNET _turns_. MRS. BENNET _runs out, takes\\nhim by the arm, and tries to pull him into the room by main force_. MR.\\nBENNET, _puzzled, submits_.]\\n\\n\\nMRS. BENNET.\\n\\n[_While she draws_ MR. BENNET _into the room_.] Oh, Mr. Bennet, you are\\nwanted immediately. We are all in an uproar. You must come and make\\nLizzy marry Mr. Collins, for she vows she will not have him, and, if you\\ndo not make haste, Mr. Collins will change his mind and not have _her_.\\n\\n\\nMR. BENNET.\\n\\nI have not the pleasure of understanding you. Of what are you talking?\\n\\n\\nMRS. BENNET.\\n\\nOf Mr. Collins and Lizzy! Lizzy declares she will not have Mr. Collins,\\nand Mr. Collins begins to say he will not have Lizzy.\\n\\n\\nMR. BENNET.\\n\\nLizzy? I thought it was Jane.\\n\\n\\nMRS. BENNET.\\n\\nNo--no--It\\'s Lizzy now!\\n\\n\\nMR. BENNET.\\n\\nAh! And what am I to do on the occasion? It seems a hopeless business.\\n\\n\\nMRS. BENNET.\\n\\nSpeak to Lizzy. There she is. [_Pointing to_ ELIZABETH _at the\\nfireplace_.] Tell her that you insist upon her marrying him.\\n\\n\\nMR. BENNET.\\n\\n[_Turning to_ ELIZABETH.] Come here, child. [ELIZABETH _goes to her\\nfather_.] This is an affair of importance. I understand that Mr. Collins\\nhas made you an offer of marriage. Is this true?\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nYes--papa--it--is.\\n\\n\\nMR. BENNET.\\n\\nVery well--and this offer of marriage you have refused.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nI have, sir.\\n\\n\\nMR. BENNET.\\n\\nWe now come to the point. Your mother insists upon your accepting him.\\nIs it not so, Mrs. Bennet?\\n\\n\\nMRS. BENNET.\\n\\nYes, or I will never see her again!\\n\\n\\nMR. BENNET.\\n\\nAn unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth. From this day, you must\\nbe a stranger to one of your parents. Your mother will never see you\\nagain, if you do _not_ marry Mr. Collins; and _I_ will never see you\\nagain if you _do_.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nACT II\\n\\n\\n     _The Conservatory or Orangery at Netherfield. On one side, an\\n     archway, approached by two or three steps and hung with curtains,\\n     separates the Orangery from the ball-room. On the opposite side is\\n     a smaller archway with curtains, which are looped back, giving a\\n     glimpse of the drawing-room beyond. There is another door on the\\n     right._ BINGLEY _is discovered directing two_ FOOTMEN, _who are\\n     putting a bench in place_. DARCY _stands watching him_.\\n\\n\\nBINGLEY.\\n\\nA little more to the right, Martin. That will do. Push those lights\\nfarther back--behind the trees. Yes, that is better. [_Looking about\\nhim._] I think that is all. You may go. [_The men leave the room._]\\nWell, Darcy, do you approve of the arrangements? Have you anything to\\nsuggest? Any criticisms?\\n\\n\\nDARCY.\\n\\nI have no criticisms for the arrangements.\\n\\n\\nBINGLEY.\\n\\n[_Laughing._] But you have for the _ball_. Yes, I know--still I was\\nreally obliged to keep my promise.\\n\\n\\nDARCY.\\n\\nI am glad to find that a promise is with you an obligation.\\n\\n\\nBINGLEY.\\n\\nOh, come, Darcy! I understand. Set your mind at rest. I am going to\\nLondon with you, although I must say I do not see the necessity for it.\\nI think you are exaggerating the effect of any small attentions of mine\\ntoward Miss Bennet. However, we will cling together, and fly a common\\ndanger.\\n\\n\\nDARCY.\\n\\n[_Coldly._] Common danger?\\n\\n\\nBINGLEY.\\n\\n[_Smiling._] Yes, common danger! I, too, have eyes. Where will you match\\nthe wit and vivacity of Miss Elizabeth Bennet?\\n\\n\\nDARCY.\\n\\n[_Quietly._] She is indeed charming, and I admit that were it not for\\nthe inferiority of her connections, I might be in some danger. [_Very\\ncoolly and confidently._] But they form, for me, an insurmountable\\nbarrier against any possible peril.\\n\\n\\nBINGLEY.\\n\\nLove laughs at bars, Darcy! [DARCY _looks annoyed_.] No,--I won\\'t! It\\nreally is not fair, since it is my fault. You would never have been put\\nto this test if you hadn\\'t been so good as to stay on here with me after\\nthat----\\n\\n[_Stopping suddenly, and with an entire change from his former bantering\\ntone, he says in a hesitating manner._] Darcy, do you really think you\\nshould be silent about Wickham?\\n\\n\\nDARCY.\\n\\n[_Haughtily._] Decidedly! I do not choose to lay my private affairs\\nbefore the world.\\n\\n\\nBINGLEY.\\n\\nBut the fellow is sailing under false colours. You do not know what the\\nresult may be. I really must speak of this again, Darcy, even at the\\nrisk of offending you. [DARCY _makes an impatient gesture_.] I am truly\\nconcerned at the foothold this rascal has already gained in the Bennet\\nfamily. What he has failed to accomplish once he may succeed in again.\\nThese young ladies have no brother to defend them.\\n\\n\\nDARCY.\\n\\nNeither have they the wealth to excite Wickham\\'s cupidity. At any rate I\\ndo not wish to be the one to enlighten the neighbourhood. Besides, I\\nunderstand that he has left Meryton.\\n\\n\\nBINGLEY.\\n\\nEven so--I---- [_He is interrupted by_ MISS BINGLEY, _who enters gaily\\nfrom the drawing-room_.]\\n\\n\\nMISS BINGLEY.\\n\\nAh! Here you are! [_To_ DARCY.] Will you be so kind? [_She holds out\\nher arm for him to clasp her bracelet._] Your sister Georgiana should be\\nhere, Mr. Darcy. [_To her brother._] Charles, you should have insisted\\non her coming.\\n\\n\\nBINGLEY.\\n\\nI am not in the habit of insisting with Darcy.\\n\\n\\nMISS BINGLEY.\\n\\n[_Laughingly._] Very true. [_To_ DARCY, _who has at length succeeded in\\nfastening the bracelet_.] Thank you. [_Looking about her._] It is vastly\\npretty, Charles, but I am much mistaken if there are not some among us\\nto whom a ball will be rather a punishment than a pleasure.\\n\\n\\nBINGLEY.\\n\\n[_Laughing._] If you mean Darcy, he may go to bed, if he pleases, before\\nit begins.\\n\\n\\nMISS BINGLEY.\\n\\nBut, Charles, it would certainly be more rational if conversation\\ninstead of dancing were made the order of the day.\\n\\n\\nBINGLEY.\\n\\nMuch more rational, my dear Caroline, but it would not be near so much\\nlike a ball.\\n\\n\\nMARTIN, THE FOOTMAN.\\n\\n[_Entering, to_ BINGLEY.] Several of the carriages have arrived, sir,\\nand the guests will soon be entering the ball-room.\\n\\n\\nBINGLEY.\\n\\n[_To the_ FOOTMAN.] Very well. [_To_ MISS BINGLEY.] Come Caroline, we\\nmust be at our post. We will leave Darcy to make up his mind whether he\\nwill join us later.\\n\\n     [BINGLEY _and his sister disappear through the archway leading to\\n     the ball-room_. DARCY _does not follow them, but walks thoughtfully\\n     up and down the room. The sound of a voice is heard announcing_.]\\n\\nTHE VOICE.\\n\\nMrs. Long--the Miss Longs. [_A pause._] Colonel Forster and Mr. Denny.\\n[_A pause._] Mr. and Mrs. Goulding. [_A pause._] Mrs. Bennet--the Miss\\nBennets. [DARCY _stops in his walk and goes toward the ball-room\\narchway--then he walks once more up and down_.] Mrs. King--Miss King.\\n[DARCY _again moves toward the ball-room; he lifts the curtain,\\nhesitates--looks in--then disappears_.] Sir William and Lady Lucas--Miss\\nLucas--Mr. Robinson.\\n\\n     [_The music now begins, the stage is left empty. After a short\\n     pause_, ELIZABETH _and_ CHARLOTTE _appear between the curtains of\\n     the ball-room archway_.]\\n\\nCHARLOTTE.\\n\\n[_Peeps in--then enters._] Isn\\'t this pretty! Come in here for a moment,\\nEliza. I want to tell you something.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\n[_Following her._] Why _did_ I promise to dance with Mr. Darcy just now!\\nWhy did not I have more presence of mind!\\n\\n     [_They sit on the bench together while they talk; the guests, at\\n     the back, pass to and from the drawing-room and ball-room, and the\\n     sound of music is heard faintly._]\\n\\nCHARLOTTE.\\n\\nI dare say you will find him very agreeable.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nHeaven forbid! That would be the greatest misfortune of all. To find a\\nman agreeable whom one is determined to hate! Do not wish me such an\\nevil.\\n\\n\\nCHARLOTTE.\\n\\nI wouldn\\'t be a simpleton, Eliza. You are angry because Wickham is not\\nhere, but I wouldn\\'t allow my fancy for him to make me unpleasant in the\\neyes of a man of ten times his consequence.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nMy _fancy_ for Wickham, as you choose to call it, is simply my sympathy\\nfor a most ill-used man: also the relief of meeting with good manners\\nand a good understanding after the insufferable pride of Mr. Darcy, and\\nthe stupid pomposity of that _dreadful_ Mr. Collins! [CHARLOTTE\\n_starts_.] Oh, my dear Charlotte, I have never thanked you half enough\\nfor helping us to endure that man. It was so good-natured in you to\\nsacrifice yourself by listening to those interminable speeches of\\nhis.--I am more obliged to you than I can express. But oh, what a relief\\nit is to know that he is really gone!\\n\\n\\nCHARLOTTE.\\n\\n[_Who has listened to all this tirade in increasing embarrassment._] Oh,\\ndon\\'t! Don\\'t, Eliza! You are making it so terribly hard for me.\\nBut,--but I must tell you.--I am engaged to Mr. Collins!\\n\\n     [ELIZABETH _is stupefied with surprise and looks at_ CHARLOTTE _for\\n     a moment in silent and incredulous amazement. Then with difficulty\\n     she speaks._]\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nEngaged! Engaged to--to Mr. Collins! Oh, my dear\\nCharlotte--_impossible_! [_Hopefully._] You are joking!\\n\\n\\nCHARLOTTE.\\n\\n[_With spirit._] No, indeed, Eliza, I am in most serious earnest. Why\\nshould you be so surprised? Do you think it incredible that Mr. Collins\\nshould be able to procure _any_ woman\\'s good opinion, because he was not\\nso happy as to succeed with you?\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\n[_Confused._] Oh, no--no--of course not. And,--and you must forgive all\\nI have just said. I couldn\\'t possibly have imagined----\\n\\nCHARLOTTE.\\n\\n[_More sweetly._] No, Eliza, indeed you could not. [_She puts her hand\\non_ ELIZABETH\\'S _shoulder_.] And we shall be friends still?\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nWhy, of course, of course, dear Charlotte. It was only the--the\\nsurprise. You know how fond I am of you. You know I wish you all\\nimaginable happiness.\\n\\n\\nCHARLOTTE.\\n\\nYes, I am sure of it. You must be surprised--very much surprised, so\\nlately as Mr. Collins was wishing to marry you. But, dear Eliza, when\\nyou have had time to think it all over, I hope you will be satisfied\\nwith what I have done. I am not romantic. I ask only a comfortable home,\\nand, considering Mr. Collins\\' situation in life, I am convinced that my\\nchance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on\\nentering the marriage state.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\n[_In an absent manner._] Undoubtedly.\\n\\n\\nCHARLOTTE.\\n\\n[_Looking at Elizabeth affectionately and wistfully._] And you will come\\nto visit me sometimes? I could not bear to lose you, Eliza!\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\n[_Looking up, and patting_ CHARLOTTE\\'S _hand_.] Surely, Charlotte!\\n[_Smiling._] We are to be cousins, you know.\\n\\n\\nCHARLOTTE.\\n\\n[_Cheerfully._] Why, so we are!\\n\\n[COLONEL FORSTER _comes from the ball-room_. LYDIA _and_ DENNY _enter\\nfrom the drawing-room_.]\\n\\n\\nCOLONEL FORSTER.\\n\\n[_Hurriedly going to_ CHARLOTTE.] I am to have the honour of this reel,\\nI believe, Miss Lucas.\\n\\n\\nCHARLOTTE.\\n\\nOh yes, Colonel Forster.\\n\\n     [_She goes out with_ FORSTER, _leaving_ ELIZABETH _alone, still\\n     seated_. LYDIA _and_ DENNY _approach_ ELIZABETH.]\\n\\nLYDIA.\\n\\nI think we are being treated abominably ill, Lizzy! It seems that Mr.\\nWickham has gone off on business somewhere, so he will not be here at\\nall. [LYDIA _looks off toward the ball-room_.]\\n\\n\\nDENNY.\\n\\n[_Aside to_ ELIZABETH _significantly_.] I do not imagine his business\\nwould have called him away just now if he had not wished to avoid a\\ncertain gentleman.\\n\\n\\nLYDIA.\\n\\n[_Suddenly._] Why, Mr. Denny--I do believe the reel is half over--I\\ndearly love a reel! We shall miss it, altogether. Come! [_She drags_\\nDENNY _off_.]\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\n[_Alone._] Well! Well! The world is surely upside down. Charlotte\\nand--Collins! _What_ a match!\\n\\n\\nDARCY.\\n\\n[_Approaching from the ball-room._] Do not you feel a great inclination,\\nMiss Bennet, to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel?\\n\\n[ELIZABETH _makes no answer_.]\\n\\nDo not you enjoy the reel, Miss Bennet?\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\n[_Looking up._] Oh, I heard you before, but I could not immediately\\ndetermine what to say in reply. You wanted me, I know, to say--\"Yes,\"\\nthat you might have the pleasure of despising my taste; but I always\\ndelight in overthrowing that kind of scheme. I have therefore made up my\\nmind to tell you that I do not want to dance a reel at all; and now\\ndespise me, if you dare!\\n\\n\\nDARCY.\\n\\n[_Smiling._] I do not dare.\\n\\n     [MISS BINGLEY _enters from the ball-room with an officer. They talk\\n     together._]\\n\\nCOLONEL FORSTER.\\n\\n[_Entering from the ball-room, and looking about him, sees_ ELIZABETH\\n_and comes to her_.] May I have the honour, Miss Bennet?\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nI do not dance the reel, Colonel Forster.\\n\\n\\nCOLONEL FORSTER.\\n\\nOh, the reel is over. This is our dance.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nOh!\\n\\n     [_She goes off with_ COLONEL FORSTER. DARCY _remains where_\\n     ELIZABETH _leaves him and watches her till she disappears into the\\n     ball-room. The officer bows and leaves_ MISS BINGLEY.]\\n\\nMISS BINGLEY.\\n\\n[_Approaching_ DARCY.] I can guess the subject of your reverie.\\n\\n\\nDARCY.\\n\\nI should imagine not.\\n\\n\\nMISS BINGLEY.\\n\\nYou are considering how insufferable it would be to pass many evenings\\nin such society. Indeed, I am quite of your opinion. I was never more\\nannoyed. The insipidity and yet the noise;--the nothingness and yet the\\nself-importance of all these people! What would I give to hear your\\nstrictures on them!\\n\\n\\nDARCY.\\n\\nYour conjecture is totally wrong. I assure you, my mind was more\\nagreeably engaged. I was meditating on the very great pleasure which a\\npair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow.\\n\\n\\nMISS BINGLEY.\\n\\n[_Looking at him very meaningly and sweetly, speaks with coquetry._]\\nIndeed! And will not you tell me what lady has the credit of inspiring\\nsuch reflections?\\n\\n\\nDARCY.\\n\\n[_With great intrepidity._] Miss Elizabeth Bennet.\\n\\n\\nMISS BINGLEY.\\n\\n[_Taken aback._] Miss Elizabeth Bennet! I am all astonishment! How long\\nhas she been such a favourite? Pray when am I to wish you joy?\\n\\n\\nDARCY.\\n\\nThat is exactly the question which I expected you to ask. A lady\\'s\\nimagination is very rapid: it jumps from admiration to love, from love\\nto matrimony in a moment. I knew you would be wishing me joy.\\n\\n\\nMISS BINGLEY.\\n\\nNay, if you are so serious about it I shall consider the matter as\\nabsolutely settled. You will have a charming mother-in-law! Of course\\nshe will always be at Pemberley with you. Perhaps you might give her a\\nfew hints as to the advantage of holding her tongue.\\n\\n\\nDARCY.\\n\\nThank you. Have you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity?\\n\\n\\nMISS BINGLEY.\\n\\nOh, yes! Let the portrait of your uncle, the attorney, be placed next to\\nyour great uncle, the Judge. They are in the same profession, you know,\\nonly in different lines. As for your Elizabeth\\'s picture, you must not\\nattempt to have it taken, for what painter could do justice to those\\nbeautiful eyes!\\n\\n\\nDARCY.\\n\\nIt would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression; but their\\ncolour and shape, and the eyelashes, so remarkably fine, might be\\ncopied.\\n\\n\\nMISS BINGLEY.\\n\\n[_Sarcastically._] Oh, I fear not--[ELIZABETH _and_ COLONEL FORSTER,\\n_with others, enter from the ball-room_--MRS. BENNET _with_ LADY LUCAS\\n_from the drawing-room_.] Here comes the fair one--[_Seeing_ MRS.\\nBENNET.]--and mamma-in-law as well. I will not intrude on the family\\nparty.\\n\\n     [_She goes off laughing and mingles with the guests._ COLONEL\\n     FORSTER _bows and leaves_ ELIZABETH _with her mother_. BINGLEY\\n     _enters with_ JANE _from the drawing-room_. _He sees_ DARCY, _who\\n     is standing where_ MISS BINGLEY _left him, and comes to him_.\\n\\nBINGLEY.\\n\\nI thought this next dance was the one you liked so much, Darcy. Let me\\nfind you a partner.\\n\\n\\nDARCY.\\n\\n[_Starting, as if from a reverie._.] So it is. Thank you--I have a\\npartner.\\n\\n     [_He goes to_ ELIZABETH, _bows, and they go into the ball-room\\n     together_. MRS. BENNET _and_ MRS. LONG _follow them_.]\\n\\nBINGLEY.\\n\\n[_Looking after_ DARCY _with a smile, turns to_ JANE.] You must be\\ntired, Miss Bennet. I propose that we sit quietly through this dance. Do\\nyou agree?\\n\\n\\nJANE.\\n\\nYes, indeed. [_She sits on the bench._] It will be very pleasant.\\n[_Looking about her._] How very prettily you have arranged all the\\nrooms, Mr. Bingley.\\n\\n\\nBINGLEY.\\n\\nI am so glad you think so. I feared they were rather inconvenient for so\\nlarge a party.\\n\\n\\nJANE.\\n\\nOh, I find them delightful!\\n\\n\\nBINGLEY.\\n\\nYou are always charitable, Miss Bennet. It seems to me you always manage\\nto see the best side of everything. I never knew you to say an ill word\\nabout a person or a place.\\n\\n\\nJANE.\\n\\n[_Smiling._] Oh, I fear that is not quite exact. I only try to see\\nthings in their best light, perhaps.\\n\\n\\nBINGLEY.\\n\\nThat is just it. The rest of us rarely try to see things in that way. So\\nyou see I have proved my case. You are too amiable.\\n\\n\\nJANE.\\n\\nNot for to-night, Mr. Bingley. Everybody is of one mind to-night. There\\nis but one point of view--you are giving nothing but pleasure.\\n\\n\\nBINGLEY.\\n\\n[_Soberly._] I wish it were so--but---- [_With impulsive earnestness._]\\nDear Miss Bennet, I wish to tell you--I must tell you----\\n\\n     [_He is interrupted by the people coming in again from the dance._\\n     DARCY _and_ ELIZABETH _enter with_ SIR WILLIAM LUCAS _and others_.\\n     BINGLEY _and_ JANE _rise from their seats and walk slowly toward\\n     the back of the room_. DARCY _escorts_ ELIZABETH _to a seat and\\n     stands by her. They are both silent for a moment._]\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nIt is your turn to say something now, Mr. Darcy. I talked about the\\ndance, and you ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the\\nrooms, or the number of couples.\\n\\n\\nDARCY.\\n\\n[_Smiling._] I assure you I will say whatever you wish.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nVery well, that reply will do for the present. Perhaps by and by I may\\nobserve that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones.\\n\\n\\nDARCY.\\n\\nDo you talk by rule then?\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nSometimes. One must speak a little, you know,--and yet for the advantage\\nof some, conversation ought to be so arranged that they may have the\\ntrouble of saying as little as possible.\\n\\n\\nDARCY.\\n\\nAre you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do you\\nimagine that you are gratifying mine?\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\n[_Archly._] Both, for I have always seen a great similarity in the turn\\nof our minds; we are each of an unsocial, taciturn disposition,\\nunwilling to speak, unless we expect to say something that will amaze\\nthe whole room and be handed down to posterity with all the _éclat_ of a\\nproverb.\\n\\n\\nDARCY.\\n\\nThis is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I am sure.\\nHow near it may be to mine, I cannot pretend to say. You think it a\\nfaithful portrait, undoubtedly.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nI shall not decide on my own performance. [_There is a short silence;\\nthen, as if with an effort_, ELIZABETH _speaks_.] I am surprised not to\\nsee Mr. Wickham here to-night. I find that he is a great favourite with\\nthe officers. He has made many friends among them.\\n\\n\\nDARCY.\\n\\n[_With great hauteur._] Mr. Wickham is blessed with such happy manners\\nas may insure his _making_ friends; whether he may be equally capable of\\n_retaining_ them is less certain.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\n[_Excitedly._] He has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship, and in\\na manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life.\\n\\n[_They are both silent._]\\n\\n\\nSIR WILLIAM LUCAS.\\n\\n[_Coming up to them all urbanity and smiles._] What a charming amusement\\nfor young people this dancing is, Mr. Darcy! I consider it as one of the\\nfirst refinements of polished societies.\\n\\n\\nDARCY.\\n\\nCertainly, sir, and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst\\nthe less polished societies of the world: every savage can dance.\\n\\n\\nSIR WILLIAM.\\n\\n[_Smiling._] Do you often dance at St. James?\\n\\n\\nDARCY.\\n\\nNever, sir.\\n\\n\\nSIR WILLIAM.\\n\\nYou have a house in town, I conclude.\\n\\n[MR. DARCY _bows, but does not speak_.]\\n\\n\\nSIR WILLIAM.\\n\\nI had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself: but I did not feel\\nquite certain that the air of London would agree with Lady Lucas.\\n\\n     [MR. DARCY _bows in silence again_--ELIZABETH _is amused_.]\\n\\nSIR WILLIAM.\\n\\nBut I must not further interrupt you, sir! I only wish to tell you once\\nmore how highly gratified I have been by your superior dancing; allow me\\nalso to say that your fair partner does not disgrace you. It is a great\\npleasure to see you together. I must hope to--to have this pleasure\\noften repeated, especially when a certain desirable event, my dear Miss\\nEliza, [_Glancing at_ BINGLEY _and_ JANE, _who are talking earnestly\\ntogether at the back of the scene_.] shall take place. What\\ncongratulations will then flow in: but let me not interrupt you--you\\nwill not thank me, Mr. Darcy, for detaining you from the bewitching\\nconverse of that young lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me!\\n\\n\\nDARCY.\\n\\n[_Murmurs to himself._] So! [_Looking earnestly at_ BINGLEY _and_ JANE,\\n_he seems much impressed by what_ SIR WILLIAM _has said_. ELIZABETH\\n_notices this. Recovering himself_, DARCY _turns to her again_.] Sir\\nWilliam\\'s interruption has made me forget what we were talking of.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nI do not think we were speaking at all. Sir William could not have\\ninterrupted any two people who had less to say for themselves. We have\\ntried two or three subjects already without success, and what we are to\\ntalk of next, I cannot imagine.\\n\\n\\nDARCY.\\n\\n[_Smiling._] What think you of books?\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nBooks? Oh no: I am sure we never read the same, or not with the same\\nfeelings.\\n\\n\\nDARCY.\\n\\nI am sorry you think so, but if that be the case, there can at least be\\nno want of subject. We may compare our different opinions of them.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nNo, I cannot talk of books at a ball--my head is always full of\\nsomething else.\\n\\n\\nDARCY.\\n\\nThe present always occupies you in such scenes, does it?\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\n[_In an absent manner._] Yes, always. [_Suddenly._] I remember hearing\\nyou once say, Mr. Darcy, that you hardly ever forgave; that your\\nresentment once created was unappeasable. You are very cautious, I\\nsuppose, as to its being created?\\n\\n\\nDARCY.\\n\\n[_Firmly._] I am.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nAnd never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?\\n\\n\\nDARCY.\\n\\nI hope not.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nIt is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion, to\\nbe secure of judging properly at first.\\n\\n\\nDARCY.\\n\\nMay I ask to what these questions lead?\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nMerely to the illustration of your character. I am trying to make it\\nout.\\n\\n\\nDARCY.\\n\\nAnd what is your success?\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\n[_Shaking her head._] I do not get on at all. I hear such different\\naccounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly.\\n\\n\\nDARCY.\\n\\n[_Gravely._] I can readily believe that reports may vary greatly with\\nrespect to me; and I could wish, Miss Bennet, that you were not to\\nsketch my character at the present moment, as there is reason to fear\\nthat the performance would reflect no credit on either.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nBut if I do not take your likeness now I may never have another\\nopportunity.\\n\\n\\nDARCY.\\n\\n[_Very stiffly._] I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours.\\n\\n[MISS BINGLEY _enters from the ball-room. She comes directly to_ DARCY\\n_and_ ELIZABETH.]\\n\\n\\nMISS BINGLEY.\\n\\nOh, Mr. Darcy--would you be so good as to go to Charles? He wishes very\\nmuch to consult with you about some of the table arrangements. You will\\nfind him in the dining-parlour. [_With exaggerated politeness to_\\nELIZABETH.] That is, if Miss Bennet will permit you.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\n[_Carelessly._] Oh, certainly.\\n\\n[DARCY _bows and goes out_.]\\n\\n\\nMISS BINGLEY.\\n\\n[_To_ ELIZABETH, _after a moment\\'s silence_.] So, Miss Bennet, I hear\\nthat you are quite delighted with George Wickham. He must have told you\\nall a pretty tale. As to Mr. Darcy\\'s using him ill, it is perfectly\\nfalse. I do not know the particulars, but I do know that George Wickham\\nhas treated Mr. Darcy in a most infamous manner. His coming into the\\ncounty at all is a most insolent thing. I feel very strongly on this\\npoint, Miss Bennet, as Mr. Darcy\\'s interests are so intimately\\nassociated with our own. [_She watches_ ELIZABETH.] We hope Miss\\nGeorgiana Darcy may some day be my sister. My brother admires her\\ngreatly.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\n[_With indifference._] Ah!\\n\\n\\nMISS BINGLEY.\\n\\nYes, and therefore we resent these falsehoods and this presumption on\\nthe part of George Wickham. But, really, considering his descent, we\\ncould not expect much better. He has evidently forgotten to tell you\\nthat he is the son of old Wickham, steward to the late Mr. Darcy.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\n[_Angrily._] His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the\\nsame. I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son\\nof Mr. Darcy\\'s steward, and of _that_, I can assure you, he informed me\\nhimself.\\n\\n\\nMISS BINGLEY.\\n\\n[_With a sneer._] Oh! I beg your pardon. Excuse my interference; it was\\nkindly meant.\\n\\n[_She goes out._]\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nInsolent girl! You are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by\\nsuch a paltry attack at this. I see nothing in it but your own wilful\\nignorance and the malice of Mr. Darcy.\\n\\n     [FOOTMEN _now come in with small tables, which they place about the\\n     stage_. BINGLEY _comes in and directs them_. DARCY _follows him_.]\\n\\nBINGLEY.\\n\\n[To ELIZABETH, JANE, _his sister, and others who have entered_.] I\\nthought it would be pleasant to have some of the tables here. [_To_\\nJANE.] We must have places together.\\n\\n     [_With some bustle, all seat themselves. At the table on one side\\n     are seated_ DARCY, ELIZABETH, BINGLEY _and_ JANE: _A little behind\\n     them are_ MISS BINGLEY _with_ COLONEL FORSTER, CHARLOTTE LUCAS\\n     _with an officer. At the table on the opposite side is_ MRS. BENNET\\n     _with_ SIR WILLIAM _and_ LADY LUCAS. _Behind them are more tables\\n     at which other guests are seated._]\\n\\nLYDIA.\\n\\n[_Entering with_ DENNY, _much excited, goes to_ MRS. BENNET.] Mamma,\\nhave you heard the news? Mr. Denny has just told me that the regiment is\\nto leave Meryton, and go to Brighton! Good heavens! What is to become of\\nus, mamma?\\n\\n\\nMRS. BENNET.\\n\\n[_Sympathetically._] Are they really going? Well, my love, it _is_ too\\nbad! I know how you feel. I am sure I cried for two days together when\\nColonel Millar\\'s regiment went away, five-and-twenty years ago. I\\nthought I should have broken my heart.\\n\\n\\nLYDIA.\\n\\nI am sure I shall break mine. [_Coaxingly._] Mamma, might we not _all_\\ngo to Brighton?\\n\\n\\nMRS. BENNET.\\n\\nOh, if we only could! But I fear your father will not hear of it.\\n\\n\\nLYDIA.\\n\\nOh, papa is so disagreeable! I am sure a little sea-bathing would set me\\nup forever! Wouldn\\'t it, Mr. Denny?\\n\\n\\nDENNY.\\n\\nSurely, Miss Lydia. Oh, you must manage it in some way.\\n\\n     [_They move off and take their places at one of the tables._]\\n\\nMRS. BENNET.\\n\\n[_Looking after them._] Well, Lady Lucas, it is hard for a lively young\\ngirl like my Lydia to be cooped up in a place where there is so little\\ngoing on. However, [_Looking at_ BINGLEY _and_ JANE.] we are not likely\\nto have it so very dull in the future. [_In a loud whisper to_ LADY\\nLUCAS.] You know what I mean--[_Nudging her and laughing._] Jane and\\nBingley!\\n\\n\\nLADY LUCAS.\\n\\nAh! Indeed!\\n\\n\\nMRS. BENNET.\\n\\n[_With importance and in a still louder tone._] Oh, yes! It\\'s quite\\nsettled. Such a charming young man--and Netherfield only three miles\\nfrom Longbourn! And Jane\\'s marrying will be a fine thing for my other\\ngirls. They will be sure to meet other rich men who will fall in love\\nwith them.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\n[_Who has heard the beginning of this conversation, makes a pretext to\\ngo to arrange her mother\\'s scarf and says in low tones._] Oh, mamma! Be\\ncareful, I beg. Mr. Darcy can hear you!\\n\\n\\nMRS. BENNET.\\n\\nWhat is Mr. Darcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of him? I am sure\\nwe owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing\\n_he_ may not like to hear!\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\n[_In distress._] For heaven\\'s sake, Madam, speak lower! What advantage\\ncan it be to you to offend Mr. Darcy? You will never recommend yourself\\nto his friend by so doing.\\n\\n\\nMRS. BENNET.\\n\\nThat is enough, Lizzy! I think I can take care of myself. I never knew\\nbefore that it was a crime to speak to one\\'s friends about what\\neverybody can see plainly enough, who has eyes in his head. [_Turning\\nto_ SIR WILLIAM.] Did _you_, Sir William?\\n\\n\\nSIR WILLIAM.\\n\\n[_Smiling._] Our friends usually have very sharp eyes for what is going\\non, Mrs. Bennet! [_Significantly._] I have, indeed, sometimes expected\\nthat _you_ would observe what has been going on in our own household of\\nlate.\\n\\n\\nMRS. BENNET.\\n\\n[_Sharply._] Going on? What _has_ been going on, Sir William?\\n\\n\\nSIR WILLIAM.\\n\\n[_With an important air._] It is only this, Mrs. Bennet, that Lady Lucas\\nand myself have to ask your congratulations on our very great\\nsatisfaction in the recent engagement of our daughter, Charlotte.\\n\\n\\nMRS. BENNET.\\n\\nCharlotte! Engaged! Why, who in the world is going to marry _her_?\\n\\n     [SIR WILLIAM _draws himself up with offended dignity_; LADY LUCAS\\n     _bridles_.]\\n\\nSIR WILLIAM.\\n\\nThe gentleman whom my daughter has honoured with her hand is your\\nhusband\\'s cousin--Mr. Collins!\\n\\n\\nMRS. BENNET.\\n\\n[_Rising in rage and amazement._] Mr. Collins! Marry your Charlotte?\\nGood Lord, Sir William, how can you tell such a story! Do not you know\\nthat Mr. Collins is going to marry my Lizzy--or--or one of my other\\ngirls!\\n\\n\\nLADY LUCAS.\\n\\nWell, really, Mrs. Bennet!\\n\\n\\nSIR WILLIAM.\\n\\n[_Offended._] What I have told you is quite true, nevertheless, Mrs.\\nBennet. The whole matter was settled before Mr. Collins returned to\\nHunsford. I am sorry we are not to receive your good wishes.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\n[_Hastily._] Oh, but you _are_, Sir William! Charlotte has already told\\nme all about her engagement, and we shall be most happy to welcome her\\nas a cousin.\\n\\n\\nSIR WILLIAM.\\n\\n[_Mollified and with gallantry._] Thank you, Miss Elizabeth! I am sure\\nother congratulations will shortly be in order.\\n\\n     [_He glances significantly at_ DARCY; ELIZABETH _draws herself up_.\\n     SIR WILLIAM, _smiling, makes a little bow and then turns to the\\n     table, where he and_ LADY LUCAS _busy themselves with their\\n     supper_.]\\n\\nMRS. BENNET.\\n\\n[_To_ ELIZABETH.] So Charlotte has told you, has she? I don\\'t believe a\\nword of it!\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nOh, mamma!\\n\\n\\nMRS. BENNET.\\n\\nI am sure Mr. Collins has been taken in. Well, I trust they will never\\nbe happy together, and I hope the match will be broken off.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\n[_Imploringly._] Mamma!\\n\\n\\nMRS. BENNET.\\n\\n[_Turning on_ ELIZABETH _in a rage_.] And _you_ are the cause of the\\nwhole mischief, Lizzy! I think I have been barbarously used by you all!\\n\\n     [_While this conversation has been going on, the other guests have\\n     been taking their supper._ COLONEL FORSTER _now rises with a glass\\n     of wine in his hand_.]\\n\\nCOLONEL FORSTER.\\n\\nLadies and gentlemen---- [_The buzz of conversation ceases._] Ladies and\\ngentlemen, I should like to propose the health of Mr. Bingley.\\n\\n\\nALL.\\n\\nMr. Bingley!\\n\\n\\nCOLONEL FORSTER.\\n\\n[_Raising his glass._] To Mr. Bingley--may the pleasure which he has\\ngiven us all to-night be but a foretaste of the future happiness which\\nhe will both _receive_ and _give_ in this community.\\n\\n\\nALL.\\n\\nMr. Bingley--Colonel Forster!--Mr. Bingley!\\n\\n[_All drink as_ BINGLEY _bows_.]\\n\\n\\nSIR WILLIAM.\\n\\n[_Rising._] And may _I_ be allowed to still farther express the\\nsentiments of this community, by proposing another toast in which I am\\nsure you will all join me with enthusiasm? [_Raising his glass._] To the\\nMaster of Netherfield! May he retain that title from his present\\nfortunate youth, to his future green and honoured old age!\\n\\n\\nALL.\\n\\n[_Drinking._] Mr. Bingley! Sir William! Mr. Bingley!\\n\\n\\nBINGLEY.\\n\\n[_Rising._] Ladies and gentlemen! Friends!\\n\\n\\nALL.\\n\\nHear! Hear!\\n\\n\\nBINGLEY.\\n\\nI--I really cannot tell you how much I am touched by the very kind\\nwords of Colonel Forster and Sir William! And--and I only wish that I\\ndeserved them.\\n\\n\\nALL.\\n\\nIndeed, you do!\\n\\n\\nBINGLEY.\\n\\n[_Embarrassed and looking toward_ DARCY, _who with folded arms, is\\nstaring at the ceiling_.] No, I do not. I--I did not like to speak of\\nsuch a painful thing on an occasion like this, and so I have told no one\\nof the fact that I am about to--to leave Netherfield.\\n\\n\\nALL.\\n\\nLeave Netherfield! Oh! Oh!\\n\\n\\nBINGLEY.\\n\\n[_Still more ill at ease._] Yes.--It is a very sudden decision, but--but\\nimportant interests have made it necessary for me to--[_Lamely._] to\\nleave Netherfield.\\n\\n\\nSIR WILLIAM.\\n\\nBut only for a time, Mr. Bingley! Let us hope it will only be a--a\\n_temporary_ separation.\\n\\n\\nMRS. BENNET.\\n\\nWhy, surely, Mr. Bingley, you will be back again very soon.\\n\\n\\nBINGLEY.\\n\\n[_In a dogged manner._] No--no. I am afraid my returning at all is\\nextremely uncertain. In fact, I--I expect to leave Netherfield\\n_permanently_.\\n\\n     [_Great consternation._ JANE _looks down_. ELIZABETH _looks at_\\n     DARCY. MISS BINGLEY _has a triumphant smile_.]\\n\\nCOLONEL FORSTER.\\n\\n[_Incredulously._] Oh, my dear Mr. Bingley!\\n\\n\\nSIR WILLIAM.\\n\\n[_Solemnly._] This is, indeed, a calamity.\\n\\n\\nMRS. BENNET.\\n\\n[_To_ ELIZABETH.] Good Lord, Lizzy, poor Jane! What----\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nOh, hush, mamma!\\n\\n\\nBINGLEY.\\n\\n[_Looks again at_ DARCY, _who remains perfectly calm through all this\\ncommotion. This time the sight of him seems to make_ BINGLEY _somewhat\\nangry, and he pulls himself together and speaks in a firmer tone and in\\na more cheerful manner_.] But, my friends, nobody knows what may happen.\\nWe shall undoubtedly all meet again sometime, and meanwhile, you must\\nnot let what I have said spoil your pleasure. [_The music is now heard\\nagain in the ball-room._] There is the music. We must have another dance\\ntogether.\\n\\n     [_There is a general movement among the guests. Those at the back\\n     of the room begin to go into the ball-room._]\\n\\nBINGLEY.\\n\\n[_To_ JANE, COLONEL FORSTER, _and others near him_.] Let us make up a\\nset here; I think there will be room.\\n\\n\\nCOLONEL FORSTER.\\n\\nCapital idea!\\n\\n[_The_ FOOTMEN _remove the tables_.]\\n\\n\\nMISS BINGLEY.\\n\\nOh, yes, capital! [_With meaning, to_ DARCY.] Do not you think so, Mr.\\nDarcy?\\n\\n[DARCY _bows stiffly, without speaking_.]\\n\\n\\nCOLONEL FORSTER.\\n\\nMiss Bingley, may I have the pleasure?\\n\\n     [_She bows, looks daggers at_ DARCY, _and takes her place in the\\n     dance_.]\\n\\nBINGLEY.\\n\\n[_To_ JANE.] Miss Bennet, will you grant me the happiness? [DARCY _gives\\nhim a look which_ ELIZABETH _sees_.] The--the _final_ happiness of my\\nstay at Netherfield.\\n\\n\\nJANE.\\n\\n[_Curtsies, a tremor in her voice._] Thank you.\\n\\n     [_They begin to form a set with_ MISS BINGLEY _and_ COLONEL\\n     FORSTER, LYDIA _and_ DENNY.]\\n\\nDARCY.\\n\\n[_Crossing to_ ELIZABETH.] May I have the honour, Miss Elizabeth?\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\n[_Looking at him with frank hauteur._] Thank you, Mr. Darcy, I am\\nindisposed.\\n\\n     [DARCY _bows, reddens, and crosses to the other side of the room.\\n     The music begins. Amid embarrassed astonishment_, SIR WILLIAM _and_\\n     CHARLOTTE LUCAS _fill the quadrille set. As the dance commences_,\\n     ELIZABETH _and_ DARCY, _standing at either side of the dancers,\\n     exchange a glance of the keenest pride and prejudice_.]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nACT III\\n\\n\\n     _The parlour of_ MR. COLLINS\\'S _parsonage at Hunsford. At the back\\n     of the room is an open door. This door leads directly into the\\n     garden, beyond which is seen, through an opening in the trees of\\n     the park opposite, \"the prospect of Rosings\"--the residence of_\\n     LADY CATHERINE DE BOURG--\"_a handsome, modern building on rising\\n     ground.\" A wide cottage window, also at the back of the room, gives\\n     a plain view of the passers-by. On either side of the parlour is a\\n     door, leading to other parts of the house._ ELIZABETH _is\\n     discovered standing at the open door and looking up at some one\\n     outside who is evidently climbing the trellis_.\\n\\nA VOICE (_outside._)\\n\\nIs this the cluster you wish, Miss Bennet?\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\n[_Mischievously._] No, Colonel Fitzwilliam. Those are buds; the ones\\nhigher still. There--by the eaves.\\n\\n     [ELIZABETH _laughingly watches_ COLONEL FITZWILLIAM _until he\\n     appears with a cluster of half opened roses, which he presents to\\n     her with a gallant air_.]\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\n[_Taking the roses and putting them in her girdle._]\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\n\\nCOLONEL FITZWILLIAM.\\n\\nMay not I have _one_, as my reward, Miss Bennet?\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nIs not accomplishment its own reward?\\n\\n\\nCOLONEL FITZWILLIAM.\\n\\nAnd is not the power to be generous the highest reward that can be given\\nto any accomplishment?\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nOh, surely! And so _you_ would have to be generous and get me some more\\nroses: then we should each of us have to invent new speeches, and so we\\nshould never be done till we were ready to print a phrase book. However,\\nyou have certainly won your rose. [_She gives it to him._]\\n\\n\\nCOLONEL FITZWILLIAM.\\n\\nThank you! That phrase-book is a capital idea, Miss Bennet. Nothing\\ncould please me better than just such an occupation. It would really be\\na charity, for Darcy is such a dull fellow these days that I really\\ndon\\'t know what to do with myself.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nBut we should hardly have the time for such a project. You say that you\\nand Mr. Darcy are to leave Lady Catherine on Saturday.\\n\\n\\nCOLONEL FITZWILLIAM.\\n\\nYes, if Darcy doesn\\'t put it off again. He has already paid our aunt a\\nmuch longer visit than ever before. I am at his disposal, you know. He\\narranges the business just as he pleases.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nI do not know anybody who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he\\npleases than Mr. Darcy.\\n\\n\\nCOLONEL FITZWILLIAM.\\n\\nHe likes to have his own way very well, but so do we all. It is only\\nthat he has better means of having it than many others. [_Looking at his\\nwatch._] I suppose I ought to go and look for him now. I expected to\\nfind him here, [_With a meaning smile._] as not unfrequently happens.\\nBut since he is not, he probably expects me to meet him at the\\nCrossroads.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nI imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of\\nhaving somebody at his disposal. I wonder he does not marry to secure a\\nlasting convenience of that kind. But perhaps his sister does as well\\nfor the present,--and, as she is under his sole care, he may do what he\\nlikes with her.\\n\\n\\nCOLONEL FITZWILLIAM.\\n\\nNo--that is an advantage which he must share with me. I am joined with\\nhim in the guardianship of Miss Darcy.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nAre you, indeed? And pray what sort of a guardian do you make? Does your\\ncharge give you much trouble? Young ladies of her age are sometimes a\\nlittle difficult to manage. And, if she has the true Darcy spirit, she\\nmay like to have her own way.\\n\\n     [COLONEL FITZWILLIAM _looks at_ ELIZABETH _very suspiciously as she\\n     makes this last remark_.]\\n\\nCOLONEL FITZWILLIAM.\\n\\nWhy--what?--Why do you suppose Miss Darcy is likely to give us any\\nuneasiness, Miss Bennet?\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\n[_Carelessly._] Oh, nothing at all! You need not be frightened! I never\\nheard any harm of her; she is a great favourite with a lady of my\\nacquaintance--Miss Bingley. I think I have heard you say that you knew\\nMiss Bingley.\\n\\n\\nCOLONEL FITZWILLIAM.\\n\\nI know her a little. Her brother is a pleasant, gentlemanlike man. He is\\na great friend of Darcy\\'s.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nOh, yes. Mr. Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr. Bingley and takes a\\nprodigious deal of care of him.\\n\\n\\nCOLONEL FITZWILLIAM.\\n\\nCare of him? Yes, I really believe Darcy does take care of him. From\\nsomething he has told me, I have reason to think Bingley very much\\nindebted to him. [_Stopping._] But I ought to beg his pardon, for I have\\nno right to suppose that Bingley was the person meant.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\n[_Curiously, and with ill-concealed anxiety._] What is it you mean?\\n\\n\\nCOLONEL FITZWILLIAM.\\n\\nIt is a circumstance which, of course, Darcy could not wish to be\\ngenerally known, because if it were to get round to the lady\\'s family it\\nwould be an unpleasant thing.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nYou may depend upon my not mentioning it.\\n\\n\\nCOLONEL FITZWILLIAM.\\n\\nAnd, remember, that I haven\\'t much reason for supposing it to be\\nBingley. What he told me was merely this: that he congratulated himself\\non having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most\\nimprudent marriage, but without names or any other particulars, and I\\nonly suspected it to be Bingley from believing him to be the kind of\\nyoung man to get into a scrape of that sort.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\n[_Trying to suppress her feeling._] Did Mr. Darcy give you his reasons\\nfor this interference?\\n\\n\\nCOLONEL FITZWILLIAM.\\n\\nI understood that there were some very strong objections against the\\nlady.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nIndeed! [_Trying to speak calmly._] And what arts did he use to separate\\nthem?\\n\\n\\nCOLONEL FITZWILLIAM.\\n\\n[_Smiling._] He did not talk to me of his own arts. He only told _me_,\\nwhat I have now told _you_.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nWhy was your cousin to be the judge?\\n\\n\\nCOLONEL FITZWILLIAM.\\n\\nYou are rather disposed to call his interference officious?\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\n[_Growing excited._] I do not see what right Mr. Darcy had to decide on\\nthe propriety of his friend\\'s inclination; why, upon his _own_ judgment\\nalone, Mr. Darcy was to determine in what manner his friend was to be\\nhappy. [_Recovering herself._] But as we know none of the particulars,\\nit is not fair to condemn him. It is not to be supposed that there was\\nmuch affection in the case.\\n\\n\\nCOLONEL FITZWILLIAM.\\n\\nThat is not an unnatural surmise, and I believe Darcy told me that he\\ndid not think that the lady, at least, was very deeply concerned in the\\nmatter. However, to lessen the affection on either side is to lessen the\\nhonour of my cousin\\'s triumph very sadly.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nYour cousin\\'s triumph----\\n\\n[_Greatly excited, she is about to continue, when_ CHARLOTTE\\'S _voice is\\nheard outside_.]\\n\\n\\nCHARLOTTE.\\n\\nYes, Mr. Darcy, I think I saw Colonel Fitzwilliam go up the garden path\\na few moments ago. [_Protesting._] Oh, no, Mr. Darcy, you are too kind!\\nReally----\\n\\nDARCY.\\n\\n[_Outside._] Pray, allow me.\\n\\n     [CHARLOTTE _enters, accompanied by_ DARCY, _who is carrying a\\n     basket of eggs. She wears a garden hat and gloves._]\\n\\nCHARLOTTE.\\n\\nAh, here he is. Good morning, Colonel Fitzwilliam. [_To_ DARCY.] Pray\\nlet me have the basket now, Mr. Darcy. [DARCY _gives_ CHARLOTTE _the\\nbasket, and then turns to_ ELIZABETH.]\\n\\n\\nDARCY.\\n\\nGood morning, Miss Bennet. [ELIZABETH _returns_ DARCY\\'S _greeting with a\\nself-consciousness which does not escape his notice, but the motive of\\nwhich he mistakes_. DARCY _gives a quick glance from_ ELIZABETH _to_\\nCOLONEL FITZWILLIAM, _as he turns to speak to the latter_.] Ah,\\nFitzwilliam, I thought I might find you here.\\n\\n\\nCOLONEL FITZWILLIAM.\\n\\n[_Lightly._] Yes, I have been so fortunate as to secure some of Mrs.\\nCollins\\'s early roses for Miss Bennet.\\n\\n\\nCHARLOTTE.\\n\\n[_In surprise._] Really! Have they already opened?\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\n[_Who has by this time recovered her self-possession._] A very few of\\nthem. But Colonel Fitzwilliam was obliged to climb very near to the sun\\nto get me these. [_She looks admiringly upon the flowers as she\\nspeaks._]\\n\\n\\nCOLONEL FITZWILLIAM.\\n\\n[_Showing the rose which_ ELIZABETH _has given him_.]\\n\\nAnd you see I have my reward.\\n\\n\\nDARCY.\\n\\n[_Smiling faintly._] Colonel Fitzwilliam might not have won his prize so\\neasily, Miss Bennet, had there been others in the field.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nAh, no, Mr. Darcy, I cannot lessen Colonel Fitzwilliam\\'s achievement by\\nadmitting any such possibility.\\n\\n\\nCOLONEL FITZWILLIAM.\\n\\n[_Gallantly._] Thank you, Miss Bennet!\\n\\n     [DARCY _turns away with an unconscious look of chagrin_.]\\n\\nCHARLOTTE.\\n\\nWell, surely, my roses will have to bloom their prettiest this season in\\nreturn for all the attention they have received. [_To the young men._]\\nWill not you be seated, gentlemen?\\n\\n\\nDARCY.\\n\\n[_Tartly._] Thanks, no, Mrs. Collins; I merely stopped for Colonel\\nFitzwilliam; but perhaps his rose-gathering has caused him to abandon\\nour project of taking a walk together this morning.\\n\\n\\nCOLONEL FITZWILLIAM.\\n\\nBy no means, Darcy, that pleasure has only been deferred.\\n\\n\\nDARCY.\\n\\nVery good then. We will go at once, if Mrs. Collins and Miss Bennet will\\npardon me this hasty call.\\n\\n\\nCHARLOTTE.\\n\\nCertainly, Mr. Darcy! [ELIZABETH _also, absent-mindedly, murmurs her\\nassent, for which_ DARCY _lingers with vague uneasiness before departing\\nwith_ FITZWILLIAM. CHARLOTTE _looks at_ ELIZABETH _curiously, then calls\\nto the little maid, who enters_.]\\n\\n\\nCHARLOTTE.\\n\\nMartha--take these eggs to the pantry. Do not disturb them.\\n\\n\\nMARTHA.\\n\\nVery well, ma\\'am.\\n\\n[_She curtsies and goes out._]\\n\\n\\nCHARLOTTE.\\n\\n[_Taking off her hat and gloves._] Now, Eliza, we must get to our work\\nand have a comfortable chat. You have been here nearly two weeks and we\\nreally haven\\'t had a good talk yet.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\n[_Getting out her embroidery._] Yes, you promised me a quiet visit,\\nCharlotte. But I find you are more lively here than we are at Longbourn.\\n\\n[_The two ladies sit at the table with their embroidery._]\\n\\n\\nCHARLOTTE.\\n\\nBut how could I have anticipated the arrival here of two very attentive\\nyoung gentlemen? [_Smiling at_ ELIZABETH.] It is really quite a\\nsurprising coincidence, or else Mr. Darcy has timed his visit to his\\naunt very cleverly. As to these daily visits to the parsonage--you may\\nbe sure I do not take to myself the credit of them. Neither of these\\nyoung gentlemen would ever come so often to see me. I have to thank you,\\nEliza, for this civility.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\n[_With a little temper._] You may thank a lack of occupation on their\\npart. You know very well my opinion of Mr. Darcy!\\n\\n\\nCHARLOTTE.\\n\\nYes. You have often expressed it. I wish I were as well informed of Mr.\\nDarcy\\'s opinion of Eliza.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nWhen you know the one, you know the other. They are identical.\\n\\n\\nCHARLOTTE.\\n\\nWell, perhaps under the circumstances, that is the most satisfactory\\ncondition of things. And do we hold the same opinion of Colonel\\nFitzwilliam?\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\n[_Tossing her head._] Oh, Colonel Fitzwilliam!\\n\\n\\nCHARLOTTE.\\n\\n[_Looking at_ ELIZABETH _sharply, and after a short silence_.] And so\\nJane is once more at home after her visit in London, and Lydia has gone\\nto Brighton after all. How did she ever manage to persuade your father?\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nOh, Lydia was so determined upon it that she and mamma gave my father no\\npeace till they had teased him to consent. But I am very sorry. Lydia is\\ntoo foolish, too ignorant and wilful to be trusted away from home. I\\nonly hope that no harm will come of it.\\n\\n\\nCHARLOTTE.\\n\\nAnd is Mr. Wickham still with the regiment?\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nYes, he went with it to Brighton.\\n\\n\\nCHARLOTTE.\\n\\nI hear that he is thinking of marrying Miss King, since she has just\\nreceived a legacy of ten thousand pounds. I should be sorry to think\\nthat our friend was mercenary.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nA man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant\\ndecorums which other people may observe. If Miss King does not object to\\nit, why should we?\\n\\n\\nCHARLOTTE.\\n\\n_Her_ not objecting does not justify--him.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\n[_Emphatically._] Well, have it as you choose. _He_ shall be mercenary,\\nand _she_ shall be foolish! Mr. Wickham\\'s worst fault, after all, is his\\npower of being agreeable. Thank heaven, we both of us know some men who\\nhaven\\'t one agreeable quality. Stupid men are the only ones worth\\nknowing!\\n\\n\\nCHARLOTTE.\\n\\n[_Smiling._] Well, well, Eliza! That speech savours a little\\nof--disappointment.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nOh, yes--anything you please!\\n\\n\\nCHARLOTTE.\\n\\n[_Changing the subject._] And you say that Jane is not in her usual\\nspirits?\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\n[_Shortly._] Yes.\\n\\n\\nCHARLOTTE.\\n\\nAnd she is looking poorly?\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\n[_Still more shortly._] Yes--very!\\n\\n\\nCHARLOTTE.\\n\\nDid she see much of the Bingleys in London?\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\n[_Bursting out hotly._] She saw nothing of them. Oh, Charlotte, I have\\njust had all my suspicions verified.\\n\\n\\nCHARLOTTE.\\n\\nYour suspicions?\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nYes, there has been an arrangement in all this. Mr. Bingley has been\\nkept away from Jane by---- [_Stops suddenly._]\\n\\n\\nCHARLOTTE.\\n\\n[_Looks up curiously, then speaks quickly._] Don\\'t imagine any such\\nnonsense, Eliza. A young man like Mr. Bingley so easily falls in love\\nwith a pretty girl for a few weeks--and, when accident separates them,\\nso easily forgets her, that this sort of inconstancy is very frequent.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nWe do not suffer from accident, Charlotte. A young man of independent\\nfortune does not suddenly decide of his own free will to think no more\\nof a girl with whom he was violently in love.\\n\\n\\nCHARLOTTE.\\n\\nBut were they so violently in love?\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nYes--I never saw a more promising inclination. Why, Mr. Bingley would\\ntalk to no one else--would look at no one else. Is not general\\nincivility the very essence of love?\\n\\n\\nCHARLOTTE.\\n\\n[_Smiling._] It is usually a good test. But if Jane did not return his\\naffection---- It really did not seem to me that there was anything\\n_violent_ in Jane\\'s attitude. I could never see that she showed any\\nextreme affection for Bingley.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\n[_Hotly._] Well, I know that Jane was very much in love with him, and\\nthat she showed her affection as much as her nature would allow. If\\nBingley didn\\'t see it he must have been a simpleton. No--the real\\ntrouble was that Jane didn\\'t see him often enough, perhaps, to make her\\nunderstand his character.\\n\\n\\nCHARLOTTE.\\n\\nOh, if Jane were married to Bingley to-morrow, I should think she had as\\ngood a chance of happiness as if she were studying him for a\\ntwelve-month. It is far better to know as little as possible of the\\nperson with whom you are to pass your life.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\n[_Demurely._] In some cases that is undoubtedly true.\\n\\n\\nMR. COLLINS.\\n\\n[_Appears at the garden door. He wears a wide-brimmed hat and carries a\\nhoe--also a large basket. He looks in._] Ah! A very charming domestic\\npicture! [_Taking a bunch of radishes from the basket, he speaks to_\\nCHARLOTTE.] My dear, I have found some fine early radishes. I thought it\\nwould be a graceful attention on your part to send some of these to Miss\\nde Bourg. [_He sits upon the chair near the doorway._]\\n\\n\\nCHARLOTTE.\\n\\nI fear the apothecary might object.\\n\\n\\nMR. COLLINS.\\n\\nTrue--they might not be suitable, but [_Looking at them proudly._] they\\nare very fine radishes. [_To_ ELIZABETH.] Miss Elizabeth, I am very\\nsuccessful in my gardening. I consider the work I do in my garden to be\\none of my most respectable pleasures. Lady Catherine is always ready to\\nencourage me in it, and my dear Charlotte is ever willing that I should\\nleave her side for the sake of this healthful exercise. [_Looking at the\\nradishes again._] It is, indeed, a pity that Miss de Bourg is not well\\nenough to enjoy them. My dear Charlotte has doubtless told you, Miss\\nElizabeth, of the alliance which is in prospect between Miss de Bourg\\nand Mr. Darcy. This extreme delicacy of constitution would seem to be\\nthe only bar to their happiness.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nYes, Charlotte has told me that Miss de Bourg is sickly. She will make\\nMr. Darcy a very proper wife.\\n\\n     [CHARLOTTE _looks anxiously at_ MR. COLLINS _as_ ELIZABETH _says\\n     this, but he is gazing out of the door and does not seem to notice\\n     the remark_.]\\n\\nMR. COLLINS.\\n\\nI hope you are pleased with Kent, Miss Elizabeth.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nVery much, Mr. Collins.\\n\\n\\nMR. COLLINS.\\n\\nI do not think the kingdom can boast a grander scene than the one now\\nspread before our eyes: [_Pointing._] This garden--that park with\\nRosings in the distance. Do not you think my dear Charlotte is most\\nfortunately placed, Miss Elizabeth?\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nMost fortunately, Mr. Collins.\\n\\n\\nMR. COLLINS.\\n\\nAnd when you have seen Lady Catherine, you will be more deeply\\nimpressed, I am sure. We can hardly expect her to call upon you. This\\nillness of Miss de Bourg would prevent it, and in any case it would be\\nan act of extreme condescension on her part; but I am quite confident\\nthat you will receive an invitation to drink tea of a Sunday evening\\nwith her, after Mr. Darcy and his cousin are gone, of course. And--we\\nmay later have an invitation to dinner--although I would not for the\\nworld arouse in you false hopes which may be shattered.\\n\\n\\nMARTHA.\\n\\n[_Enters in great excitement._] Oh, Mrs. Collins! Lady Catherine\\'s\\ncarriage is turning into the lane and _she_ is in it!\\n\\n\\nMR. COLLINS.\\n\\n[_Rising in great excitement_.] Lady Catherine--at this hour! What\\namazing condescension! [_He turns in a helpless manner to_ CHARLOTTE.]\\nBut, my dear, I am quite unprepared. My habiliments--I would not be\\nwanting in respect.--What shall I do?\\n\\n\\nCHARLOTTE.\\n\\n[_Hurriedly putting up her work and giving her hat and gloves to the\\nmaid._] Go make yourself ready, Mr. Collins. We will do the same.\\n[CHARLOTTE _pushes_ MR. COLLINS _gently toward the door_.]\\n\\n\\nMR. COLLINS.\\n\\n[_Protesting._] Yes--yes! But this implement----\\n\\n[_He holds out the hoe._]\\n\\n\\nCHARLOTTE.\\n\\nGive it to Martha!\\n\\n     [MR. COLLINS _hastily gives the hoe to the maid and then goes out.\\n     He instantly returns, however, and again appeals in distressed\\n     tones to his wife_.]\\n\\nMR. COLLINS.\\n\\n[_Holding out the basket._] And these radishes, my dear?\\n\\n\\nCHARLOTTE.\\n\\nMartha, take the radishes from Mr. Collins.\\n\\n\\nMARTHA.\\n\\nYes, ma\\'am.\\n\\n     [_The maid tries to hold at once--basket, hoe, hat, and gloves, as\\n     she stands in a corner, open-mouthed._]\\n\\nMR. COLLINS.\\n\\n[_Again emerging from the door._] Do not make yourself uneasy about your\\nown apparel, Miss Elizabeth; Lady Catherine is far from requiring that\\nelegance in us which becomes herself and daughter--I----\\n\\nCHARLOTTE.\\n\\n[_Impatiently._] Oh, do go, Mr. Collins! Lady Catherine will be here in\\nan instant!\\n\\n[_She shuts the door on_ MR. COLLINS.]\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\n[_Greatly amused at all this excitement._] Are you going to make any\\nchange in your dress, Charlotte? Do you wish me to do so?\\n\\n\\nCHARLOTTE.\\n\\nWell, Eliza, if you wouldn\\'t mind, I should like you to put on your\\nsprigged muslin. In spite of what Mr. Collins says, I know it would\\nplease him. I have no time to change. Is my cap straight? Oh, here she\\nis. [_To the maid, who stands staring, with her arms full._] Why,\\nMartha! Are you still there? Go! Go! [_She bustles the maid out of one\\ndoor, then runs to the other, calling her husband._] Mr. Collins! Mr.\\nCollins!\\n\\n     [_She then rushes into the garden, followed immediately by_ MR.\\n     COLLINS _in the same state of excitement_. ELIZABETH, _as she looks\\n     after them, is convulsed with laughter_.]\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nSo, at last--her high and only mightiness! No tremors, Elizabeth! Now is\\nthe time for all your courage. [_She runs laughing out of the room._]\\n\\n     [_Sounds of voices are heard, and_ LADY CATHERINE _appears escorted\\n     up the path by_ CHARLOTTE _and_ COLLINS.]\\n\\nLADY CATHERINE.\\n\\n[_As she reaches the door._] You keep too many hens, Mrs. Collins. There\\nis just a certain number which are profitable--beyond that there is\\nwaste. [LADY CATHERINE _sits on the sofa_.] A clergyman\\'s wife should\\nset an example of thrift. You should have asked my advice.\\n\\n\\nMR. COLLINS.\\n\\nMrs. Collins will in the future regulate her poultry-yard according to\\nyour directions, Lady Catherine, if you will be so condescending as to\\ngive them.\\n\\n\\nCHARLOTTE.\\n\\nYes, thank you, Lady Catherine.\\n\\n\\nMR. COLLINS.\\n\\nWill your Ladyship not take some refreshment?\\n\\n\\nCHARLOTTE.\\n\\nOh, yes--let me fetch you a cup of tea?\\n\\n\\nLADY CATHERINE.\\n\\nNo, no--I wish nothing. [_To_ MR. COLLINS.] But you may go, Mr. Collins,\\nand see if Jones is walking the horses up and down. I do not trust\\nJones.\\n\\n\\nMR. COLLINS.\\n\\nWith great pleasure, your Ladyship. [MR. COLLINS _goes out_.]\\n\\n\\nLADY CATHERINE.\\n\\n[_To_ CHARLOTTE.] I thought you had a visitor, Mrs. Collins.\\n\\n\\nCHARLOTTE.\\n\\nYes, your Ladyship--I have. It is my friend, Miss Elizabeth Bennet. She\\nis a cousin of Mr. Collins and a neighbour of ours in Hertfordshire.\\n\\n\\nLADY CATHERINE.\\n\\nI have heard about her. Fitzwilliam says she is a very genteel, pretty\\nkind of girl.\\n\\n\\nCHARLOTTE.\\n\\n[_Pleased._] Indeed she is, Lady Catherine.\\n\\n\\nLADY CATHERINE.\\n\\nWell, where is she?\\n\\n\\nCHARLOTTE.\\n\\nShe has gone to make a little change in her dress, before presenting\\nherself to your Ladyship.\\n\\n\\nLADY CATHERINE.\\n\\nOh! very proper--very proper!\\n\\n\\nCHARLOTTE.\\n\\nI am delighted to hear that Miss de Bourg is better, Lady Catherine.\\n\\n\\nLADY CATHERINE.\\n\\nYes, thank you. She is very greatly improved. [_After a slight pause,\\nwith impatience_.] Well, Miss Bennet takes her time!\\n\\n\\nCHARLOTTE.\\n\\n[_Anxiously._] I am sure she will be here in a moment. [ELIZABETH\\n_enters_.] Oh, here she is. [_Presenting_ ELIZABETH.] Lady Catherine,\\nMiss Elizabeth Bennet. [ELIZABETH _curtsies_.]\\n\\n\\nLADY CATHERINE.\\n\\n[_Without leaving her seat, looks_ ELIZABETH _over from head to foot_.]\\nOh, how do you do, Miss Bennet. You are younger than I thought!\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\n[_Smiling._] Indeed?\\n\\n\\nLADY CATHERINE.\\n\\nYou know my nephew, Mr. Darcy?\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nYes, I met him in Hertfordshire.\\n\\n\\nLADY CATHERINE.\\n\\nHumph! And you know Colonel Fitzwilliam?\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nI have only met Colonel Fitzwilliam since coming here.\\n\\n\\nLADY CATHERINE.\\n\\nHumph! Has your governess left you?\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\n[_Half laughs._] My sisters and I have never had a governess, Madam.\\n\\n\\nLADY CATHERINE.\\n\\nNo governess! I never heard of such a thing! Your mother must have been\\nquite a slave to your education.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\n[_Smiling._] I assure you she was not, Lady Catherine.\\n\\n\\nLADY CATHERINE.\\n\\nThen who taught you? Without a governess you must have been neglected.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nSuch of us as wished to learn, never wanted the means, Madam.\\n\\n\\nLADY CATHERINE.\\n\\nWell, if I had known your mother, I should have advised her most\\nstrenuously to engage a governess. I should have seen to it myself.\\n[_To_ CHARLOTTE.] Go on with your work, Mrs. Collins. A clergyman\\'s wife\\nshould set an example of industry. [_Looking at_ CHARLOTTE\\'S _embroidery\\nwith disapproval_.] I will send you some more of the parish petticoats\\nto hem, Mrs. Collins. [_To_ ELIZABETH.] Go on with your work, Miss\\nBennet. Young ladies should never be idle. [_Both_ ELIZABETH _and_\\nCHARLOTTE _go on with their embroidery. Looking hard at_ ELIZABETH.]\\nPray what is your age, Miss Bennet?\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nI am not one and twenty.\\n\\n\\nLADY CATHERINE.\\n\\nYou have sisters, have not you?\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nYes, Madam.\\n\\n\\nLADY CATHERINE.\\n\\nAre any of them out?\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nAll, Madam.\\n\\n\\nLADY CATHERINE.\\n\\nWhat! All out at once? Very odd! Out before the oldest is married!\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nReally, Madam, I think it would be very hard on the younger sisters not\\nto have their share of society because the eldest one does not happen to\\nbe married. That would hardly be likely to promote sisterly affection,\\nor delicacy of mind.\\n\\n\\nLADY CATHERINE.\\n\\nUpon my word, you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a\\nperson! Your sisters may be married before you. You must not be too\\nambitious. A good many young girls have lost their chances through being\\ntoo ambitious. [_Looking at a large picture on the wall and then\\npointing to it._] Mrs. Collins, I suppose you have shown Miss Bennet\\nthis print of Pemberley--Mr. Darcy\\'s place?\\n\\n\\nCHARLOTTE.\\n\\nYes, Lady Catherine.\\n\\n\\nLADY CATHERINE.\\n\\n[_Complacently._] Pemberley is one of the finest places in England. My\\ndaughter Anne is very fond of it, which is fortunate, since she will\\nprobably spend the most of her life there.\\n\\n\\nCHARLOTTE.\\n\\nMost fortunate, your Ladyship.\\n\\n\\nLADY CATHERINE.\\n\\n[_To_ ELIZABETH.] You see my nephews here often, Miss Bennet?\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\n[_Mischievously._] Yes, _very_ often, Lady Catherine.\\n\\n\\nLADY CATHERINE.\\n\\nHumph! Well, idle young gentlemen often make very foolish use of their\\ntime. My daughter, Miss de Bourg, is unfortunately not able to accompany\\nMr. Darcy in his walks as often as both of them could desire.\\n\\n\\nMR. COLLINS.\\n\\n[_Entering._] I think your Ladyship\\'s mind may be quite at rest about\\nthe horses. Jones seems to have them well in hand.\\n\\n\\nLADY CATHERINE.\\n\\nOh, I am glad you have come back, Mr. Collins. I am going to ask you and\\nMrs. Collins to go and see the new cottages with me. I shall take you in\\nthe carriage. [_To_ CHARLOTTE.] You had better put on a plain bonnet,\\nMrs. Collins.\\n\\n\\nCHARLOTTE.\\n\\nBy all means, your Ladyship. [_She goes out._]\\n\\n\\nLADY CATHERINE.\\n\\nAre you quite ready to go, Mr. Collins?\\n\\n\\nMR. COLLINS.\\n\\nOh--assuredly, your Ladyship--quite!\\n\\n\\nLADY CATHERINE.\\n\\n[_To_ ELIZABETH.] Miss Bennet, I should advise you to write to your\\nfamily while we are gone. [CHARLOTTE _returns in her bonnet and mantle_.\\nLADY CATHERINE _looks her over_.] Yes, that will do very well!\\n\\n\\nCHARLOTTE.\\n\\n[_To_ ELIZABETH.] We shall not be gone very long, Eliza.\\n\\n\\nLADY CATHERINE.\\n\\nI am not sure of that, Mrs. Collins, but I have provided an occupation\\nfor Miss Bennet during our absence. Good morning, Miss Bennet. I may ask\\nyou later for dinner.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\n[_Curtsying._] Good morning, Madam. [_All go out_, MR. COLLINS _showing\\nservile attentions to_ LADY CATHERINE. ELIZABETH _watches them from the\\ndoor_.] Really! I might have spared myself some of the mortifications I\\nhave felt for the shortcomings of my own family. The contrast is not\\nsuch a violent one after all. [_Looking at the writing desk._] However,\\nLady Catherine can give good advice. I really ought to write to my poor,\\ndear Jane.\\n\\n     [_She seats herself at the writing table--gets out her paper, etc.\\n     and begins her letter when the door-bell sounds._ ELIZABETH _starts\\n     and is putting away the writing materials, when the maid ushers in_\\n     MR. DARCY, _who seems much excited_.]\\n\\nDARCY.\\n\\nI am here again, Miss Bennet. I saw Mr. and Mrs. Collins drive away\\nwith my aunt. I have something which I _must_ say to you. [_He walks\\nexcitedly up and down for a moment, while_ ELIZABETH _watches him in\\namazed silence. Then he suddenly goes up to her and begins to speak in\\nan agitated manner._] Miss Bennet--in vain have I struggled! It will not\\ndo! My feelings will not be repressed! You must allow me to tell you how\\nardently I admire and love you!\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\n[_Is perfectly astounded. She stares, colours, doubts, and is silent._]\\n\\n\\nDARCY.\\n\\n[_Taking her silence for encouragement._] Miss Bennet, I can well\\nunderstand your own astonishment at this declaration, for I am amazed at\\nmyself! My feeling for you has taken possession of me against my will,\\nmy reason, and almost against my character!\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\n[_Starting in indignation._] Sir!\\n\\n\\nDARCY.\\n\\nOh, understand me, I beg of you! For yourself alone my admiration is\\nonly too natural. I share it with everyone who has the happiness of\\nknowing you. But--pardon me--for it pains me to offend you--the defects\\nof your nearest relations, the total lack of propriety so frequently\\nbetrayed by your family, has so opposed my judgment to my inclination,\\nthat it has required the utmost force of passion on my part to put them\\naside. But, my dear Miss Bennet, your triumph is complete. Your own\\nloveliness stands out the fairer in its contrast to your surroundings,\\nand I now hope that the strength of my love may have its reward in your\\nacceptance of my hand.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\n[_Who has gone through all sorts of emotions during this speech, speaks,\\nin a constrained manner as if trying to control herself._] Mr. Darcy--in\\nsuch cases as this, it is, I believe, the established mode to express a\\nsense of obligation for the sentiments avowed, however unequally they\\nmay be returned. If I could feel gratitude I would now thank you. But I\\ncannot. I have never desired your good opinion, and _you_ have certainly\\nbestowed it most unwillingly.\\n\\n\\nDARCY.\\n\\n[_Leaning against the mantel-piece, hears her words with no less\\nresentment than surprise. After a little he speaks in a voice of forced\\ncalmness._] And that is all the reply which I am to have the honour of\\nexpecting? I might perhaps wish to be informed why, with so little\\nendeavour at civility, I am thus rejected. But it is of small\\nimportance.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nI might as well inquire why, with so evident a design of insulting me,\\nyou chose to tell me that you liked me against your will, your reason,\\nand even against your character! Was not this some excuse for\\nincivility, if I was uncivil?\\n\\n\\nDARCY.\\n\\nI very clearly explained that the objections which appealed to my reason\\napplied entirely to your _family_, and in no respect to yourself.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nI am a part of my family, Mr. Darcy; and allow me to say that, since I\\nhave had the opportunity of comparing my relations with your own, the\\ncontrast is not so marked as I had been led to suppose. [DARCY\\n_starts_.] But--aside from all questions of either feeling or family--do\\nyou think any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has\\nbeen the means of ruining, perhaps forever, the happiness of a most\\nbeloved sister, and involving her in misery of the acutest kind? [DARCY\\n_looks at her with a smile of incredulity._.] Can you deny that you have\\ndone this?\\n\\n\\nDARCY.\\n\\nI have no wish of denying that I did everything in my power to separate\\nmy friend from your sister. I did not, indeed, anticipate that I should\\ninvolve either of them in \"misery\" of any kind. On your sister\\'s side,\\nat least, I was never able to discover any symptoms of peculiar regard\\nfor Mr. Bingley. While, for every reason, I must rejoice in my success\\nwith my friend; toward him I have been kinder than toward myself.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\n[_With disdain._] Your arrogance in calmly deciding the extent of other\\npeople\\'s sentiments does not surprise me. It is of a piece with your\\nwhole nature! But your interference in my sister\\'s concerns is not all.\\nLong before it had taken place, my opinion of you was decided. Your\\ncharacter was unfolded in the recital which I received months ago from\\nMr. Wickham. [DARCY _starts excitedly_.] What can you have to say on\\nthis subject? In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend\\nyourself?\\n\\n\\nDARCY.\\n\\n[_In a tone of suppressed excitement, in marked contrast to his previous\\nself-assured manner._] You take an eager interest in that gentleman.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nWho that knows what his misfortunes have been can help feeling an\\ninterest in him?\\n\\n\\nDARCY.\\n\\n[_Contemptuously._] His misfortunes! Yes, his misfortunes have been\\ngreat indeed!\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\n[_With energy._] And of your infliction! You have reduced him to his\\npresent state of poverty--comparative poverty; you have withheld the\\nadvantages which you must know to have been designed for him. You have\\ndone all this, and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes\\nwith contempt and ridicule!\\n\\n\\nDARCY.\\n\\n[_Walking up and down the room with quick steps._] And this is your\\nopinion of me? This is the estimation in which you hold me! I thank you\\nfor explaining it so fully. [_Stopping and looking at her._] Perhaps if\\nI were to divulge the truth regarding Mr. Wickham, I might give _you_ as\\ngreat a surprise as you have given _me_. [_After a slight pause._] I do\\nnot care to go into particulars, but in justice to myself, I must tell\\nyou that the man whom you consider a martyr is a profligate with the\\nmost vicious propensities. A man who should never have entered your\\nhome, for his presence there is a constant source of danger.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\n[_In indignation._] Mr. Darcy!\\n\\n\\nDARCY.\\n\\n[_With dignity._] I am ready to give you the full proofs of all I have\\nsaid, Miss Bennet, whenever you may so desire, although I would gladly\\nforget all the miserable circumstances myself, and no obligation less\\nthan the present should induce me to unfold them to any human being.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\n[_Coldly._] Your judgment in the matter of my sister\\'s happiness has\\ngiven me a gauge by which I can measure your fairness to a man who has\\nbeen so unfortunate as to offend you. My faith in Mr. Wickham is\\nunshaken.\\n\\n\\nDARCY.\\n\\n[_Looking at_ ELIZABETH _in indignation and by a great effort governing\\nhimself_.] I shall take what you have said, Miss Bennet, as a reflection\\non my _judgment_ alone; otherwise, my veracity would be at stake, and\\nthis, I am sure, you did not intend. Indeed I understand your whole\\nposition perfectly. I have erred in the manner of my declaration. Your\\nbitter accusations might have been suppressed, had I concealed my\\nstruggles. It is my own fault. I have wounded your pride. I should have\\nflattered you into the belief that I was impelled by inclination, by\\nreason, by reflection, by everything! But disguise of every sort is my\\nabhorrence. Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your\\nconnections?\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\n[_Angrily._] And do you expect _me_ to rejoice in your proposal that I\\nally myself to the conceit and impertinence of _yours_? No, Mr. Darcy!\\nThe manner of your declaration has affected me only in one way:--it has\\nspared me the concern which I might otherwise have felt in refusing you,\\nhad you behaved in a more _gentlemanlike_ way. [DARCY _starts_.] You\\ncould not, however, have made me the offer of your hand in any possible\\nway that would have tempted me to accept it. [DARCY _looks at her with\\nan expression of mortified amazement_.] I had not known you a month,\\nbefore I felt that you were the last man in the world whom I could ever\\nbe prevailed upon to marry.\\n\\n\\nDARCY.\\n\\nYou have said quite enough, Madam! I perfectly comprehend your feelings\\nand have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been. Forgive me for\\nhaving taken up so much of your time, and accept my best wishes for your\\nhealth and happiness. [DARCY _hastily leaves the room_.]\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\n[_Sinking into a chair, then getting up and walking excitedly about the\\nroom._] To insult my family! To think I was ready to fall on my knees,\\nin gratitude for his condescension! To calmly dispose of Jane\\'s\\nhappiness! [_Stopping in her walk and with a half-amused smile._] And\\nyet really to be in love with me in spite of every obstacle. [_Throwing\\nherself again into the chair, half laughing, half crying._] Oh, Jane,\\nJane! I wish you were here!\\n\\n\\nMARTHA.\\n\\n[_Enters with a letter._] Here is a letter, Miss. The express has just\\nbrought it.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nA letter? For me?\\n\\n\\nMAID.\\n\\nYes, Miss--[_She gives_ ELIZABETH _the letter; curtsies and goes out_.]\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\n[_Looking at the letter._] Why, it is from Jane! What can be the matter?\\n[_She opens the letter hurriedly and reads._] \"Dearest Lizzy--I have bad\\nnews for you, and it cannot be delayed. An express came to us last night\\nfrom Colonel Forster. He told us that Lydia had run away from Brighton\\nwith one of his officers:--to own the truth--with Wickham!\"\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nOh! Wickham! [_Going on with the letter._] \"He first thought they had\\ngone to Scotland, but, oh, Lizzy, it is far worse than that! We now know\\nthat Wickham never intended to go there, or to marry Lydia at all!\"\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nOh! [_Reading again._] \"Colonel Forster has been here to-day. He says\\nWickham is not a man to be trusted! He has left Brighton terribly in\\ndebt, and his record is bad in every way. Oh, Lizzy, our distress is\\nvery great! My father is going to London with Colonel Forster instantly\\nto try to discover the fugitives. It is hard to ask you to shorten your\\nvisit, but we are in such distress that----\" [_Darting from her seat._]\\nOh where--where is the express? I must write. No--I must go. Oh, Lydia\\nand Wickham! I must go at once! I must send someone for a carriage.\\n[_She rushes to the garden door calling._] Martha, Martha! The express!\\n[_Suddenly she calls again._] Oh, Colonel Fitzwilliam, is that you?\\n\\n\\nCOLONEL FITZWILLIAM.\\n\\n[_Appearing in the garden._] What is the matter, Miss Bennet?\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\n[_Wildly._] Oh, Colonel Fitzwilliam--the express--or can you get me a\\ncarriage? I have bad news from home. I must return at once and Mr.\\nCollins is away. Will you be so kind? [_She falls, half-fainting, upon a\\nchair near the door._]\\n\\n\\nCOLONEL FITZWILLIAM.\\n\\n[_With concern._] Certainly, my dear Miss Bennet--of course--but----\\n[_Calling off._] Darcy, don\\'t wait for me. I can\\'t join you now. Miss\\nBennet is in distress.\\n\\n\\nDARCY.\\n\\n[_Entering._] Miss Bennet? Good God! What is the matter?\\n\\n\\nCOLONEL FITZWILLIAM.\\n\\nMiss Bennet has just had bad news from home. She wishes to return, and\\ndesires a carriage.\\n\\n\\nDARCY.\\n\\n[_In a decided tone._] Do you go for the carriage, Fitzwilliam. Get one\\nfrom the stables. [FITZWILLIAM _hesitates_.]\\n\\n\\nDARCY.\\n\\nGo. I will remain with Miss Bennet.\\n\\n[FITZWILLIAM _goes out_.]\\n\\n\\nDARCY.\\n\\n[_To_ ELIZABETH _very gently_.] Shall I call the maid, Miss Bennet? A\\nglass of wine? Shall I get it for you? You are very ill.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\n[_Hardly able to speak._] No, I thank you: there is nothing the matter\\nwith me. I am quite well. I am only distressed by some dreadful news\\nwhich I have just received from Longbourn. [_She bursts into tears._]\\n\\n\\nDARCY.\\n\\n[_Helplessly._] I am sorry, very indeed!\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\n[_After a short silence._] I have just had a letter from Jane with such\\n_dreadful_ news! It cannot be concealed from anyone.\\n\\n\\nDARCY.\\n\\nI am grieved, Miss Bennet. Grieved indeed!\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nOh, Mr. Darcy, you were right. If I had only believed you! You, and\\nothers! But I could not believe it. [_She sobs._]\\n\\n\\nDARCY.\\n\\n[_Greatly moved._] What is it, my dear Miss Bennet? What has happened?\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\n[_Wildly._] Oh, I cannot tell it, and yet everyone must know! My sister\\nLydia--has--has eloped--has thrown herself into the power of--of _Mr.\\nWickham_! She has no money, nothing that can tempt him to--she is lost\\nforever! [_She sobs again._]\\n\\n\\nDARCY.\\n\\nGood God, Miss Bennet! Your sister and Wickham! Oh, this is _my_ fault.\\nI should have realised this danger--I should have spoken. My own\\nwretched experience with this man should have been told.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\n[_Wonderingly._] Your experience!\\n\\n\\nDARCY.\\n\\nYes--I--you remember. I hinted it to you--to-day. But I should long ago\\nhave spoken boldly.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nWhat do you mean?\\n\\n\\nDARCY.\\n\\nMr. Wickham attempted this same plan with my own sister--two years ago.\\nShe was an ignorant, innocent, trusting girl of fifteen. Happily, his\\nvillainy was discovered and prevented. But oh, I should have told you!\\nHad his character been known, this could not have happened.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nYou tried to tell me, Mr. Darcy. Everybody has tried to warn me. But I\\ncould not believe it, and now--it is too late, too late!\\n\\n\\nDARCY.\\n\\nLet us hope not. Is what you have told me certain--absolutely certain?\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nOh, yes. They left Brighton together on Sunday night. They are certainly\\nnot gone to Scotland.\\n\\n\\nDARCY.\\n\\nAnd what has been done, or attempted, to recover your sister?\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nMy father has gone to London. He will beg my uncle Gardiner\\'s\\nassistance. But nothing can be done! I know very well that nothing _can_\\nbe done. How is such a man to be worked on? How are they ever to be\\ndiscovered? I have not the smallest hope. It is all horrible!\\n\\n\\nDARCY.\\n\\nMiss Bennet, I have made a wretched mistake in all this. Would to Heaven\\nthat anything could be said or done on my part that might make you\\nreparation, or offer consolation to such distress!\\n\\n     [ELIZABETH _sinks sobbing into a chair while_ DARCY _walks up and\\n     down in deep thought. In a moment a carriage is heard outside--then\\n     voices._]\\n\\nDARCY.\\n\\n[_Looking out._] Mr. and Mrs. Collins are returning. What would you wish\\nme to do?\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nOh, I do not know! I do not know!\\n\\n\\nDARCY.\\n\\n[_Returning to_ ELIZABETH, _speaks quickly and in deep concern_.] You\\nreally wish to return home at once?\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\n[_Rising from her chair._] Oh, yes, yes--at once. [_Reaching her hand to\\nhim appealingly._] Take me home, Mr. Darcy! Take me home!\\n\\n     [_At this instant_ MR. AND MRS. COLLINS _appear at the garden door,\\n     and, transfixed with astonishment, stand gazing at_ DARCY _and_\\n     ELIZABETH.]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nACT IV\\n\\n\\n     _The Lawn and Shrubbery at Longbourn._ MRS. BENNET _is seated in a\\n     garden chair with pillows at her back. She has an umbrella over her\\n     head. Near her stands a table on which are bottles, dishes, etc.\\n     She wears a big cap, and is gowned in a widely-flowing, flowered\\n     chamber-robe, over which is fastened a shawl; across her knees is a\\n     lap-robe. Her entire get-up is grotesque and laughable. About her\\n     hover the housekeeper_, HILL _and_ JANE.\\n\\nJANE.\\n\\nDear mamma, do try and take some of this nice gruel. You will be ill if\\nyou do not eat something.\\n\\n\\nHILL.\\n\\nYes, do, I beg of you, Madam. Now that you are once more in the air, if\\nyou will only take some food you will feel much better.\\n\\n\\nMRS. BENNET.\\n\\n[_Fretfully._] How can I feel better? I must be ill. It is all very well\\nfor the rest of you, now that this disgrace has been brought upon\\nme--but if I had been able to carry my point--if I could have gone to\\nBrighton with all my family, this would never have happened. But poor\\ndear Lydia had nobody to take care of her. Oh, that villainous Wickham!\\nI am sure there was some great neglect or other somewhere, for Lydia is\\nnot the kind of girl to run away with a man. But no one would listen to\\nme. I was overruled, as I always am. Poor Lydia! Poor dear child!\\n\\n\\nJANE.\\n\\n[_Soothingly._] Oh, mamma, try to be calm.\\n\\n\\nHILL.\\n\\nYes, Madam, this excitement is so bad for you.\\n\\n\\nMRS. BENNET.\\n\\nHow can I help being excited? You have no feelings. Here is Mr. Bennet\\ngone away, and I know he will fight that abominable Wickham and be\\nkilled. And then what is to become of us all? The Collinses will turn us\\nout before Mr. Bennet is cold in his grave.\\n\\n\\nJANE.\\n\\nOh, mamma, do not have such terrific ideas.\\n\\n\\nMRS. BENNET.\\n\\n[_Weeping._] If my brother Gardiner is not kind to me, I do not know\\nwhat we shall do.\\n\\n\\nJANE.\\n\\nYes, yes. My Uncle Gardiner is very kind. He is doing everything in his\\npower for us. He is helping my father now in London, you know. I hope\\nhe will find Lydia, and perhaps he may be able to arrange a marriage\\nafter all. You must not give up so, dear mamma.\\n\\n\\nHILL.\\n\\nNo indeed, Madam. You must not indeed.\\n\\n\\nMRS. BENNET.\\n\\n[_Brightening._] Yes, Jane, that is true. My brother may be able to see\\nthat they are married. Write to him at once, Jane. Tell him to find them\\nout wherever they may be, and if they are not married already, make them\\nmarry. Oh, I do think that Wickham is the wickedest young man in the\\nworld to so deceive my poor innocent Lydia. But, Jane, go and write my\\nbrother and tell him that Lydia need not wait for wedding clothes--don\\'t\\nlet her even give directions till she has seen me, for she doesn\\'t know\\nwhich are the best warehouses. And oh, Jane, tell my brother to keep\\nyour father from fighting that hateful Wickham. Tell him what a dreadful\\nstate I am in.\\n\\n\\nJANE.\\n\\nYes, mamma. [_She is about to go._]\\n\\n\\nMRS. BENNET.\\n\\nWhere are you going?\\n\\n\\nJANE.\\n\\nWhy, to write the letter, mamma.\\n\\n\\nMRS. BENNET.\\n\\n[_Fretfully._] Oh, not just this minute. Don\\'t leave me alone. Where is\\nLizzy?\\n\\n\\nJANE.\\n\\nShe has gone down the road to meet the post. She hopes to bring you good\\nnews.\\n\\n\\nMRS. BENNET.\\n\\n[_Lamenting._] She had better stay here and be of some help. She has\\nonly just got home and now she leaves me. But nobody thinks of me.\\nNobody knows what I suffer. I am frightened out of my wits. I have such\\ntremblings and flutterings all over me--such spasms in my side--and\\npains in my head, and such beatings at my heart. Oh, I can get no rest\\nby night or by day! [_To_ HILL.] You might try and do something, Hill.\\nWhere is my soothing draught?\\n\\n\\nHILL.\\n\\n[_Looking._] Here, Madam. No, I must have left it in your room. I will\\nrun fetch it. [_She goes out quickly._]\\n\\n\\nJANE.\\n\\n[_Who has been looking off toward the driveway during part of this\\ntirade._] Oh, mamma--mamma! Lizzy\\'s running up the drive. She is\\nsmiling! She has some good news, I am sure.\\n\\n\\nMRS. BENNET.\\n\\nTake care, Jane. You are exciting me. Oh, my poor nerves.\\n\\n     [ELIZABETH _enters, breathless. She has a letter in her hand._]\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nOh, good news--good news, Jane!--mamma! They are married!\\n\\n\\nJANE.\\n\\nOh, Lizzy--Lizzy!\\n\\n\\nMRS. BENNET.\\n\\nYou are sure, Lizzy? Don\\'t excite me. You are sure?\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\n[_Half laughing and half crying._] Oh, yes, \\'tis certain. My dear Aunt\\nGardiner has written me all about it. They are really married! Oh, how\\ngood my uncle is! [_She kisses the letter._]\\n\\n\\nMRS. BENNET.\\n\\nOh, Jane--Oh, Lizzy! My dear, dear Lydia! She is really married! I shall\\nsee her again! Oh, my good, kind brother! But how did it happen, Lizzy?\\n\\n\\nJANE.\\n\\nYes, tell us all about it. Let me read it. [_She reaches for the\\nletter._]\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\n[_Keeping the letter._] No, I will tell you. Well, my father and my\\nuncle succeeded in finding Lydia. My aunt does not tell me just how it\\nwas done.\\n\\n\\nMRS. BENNET.\\n\\n[_Triumphantly._] And your father found that they were married after\\nall. I told him----\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nNo, mamma. They were not married, and they had no idea of being--but my\\nfather and uncle insisted upon it. They took Lydia away at once to my\\naunt\\'s house and from there, they were married only yesterday at St.\\nClement\\'s Church.\\n\\n\\nMRS. BENNET.\\n\\nSt. Clement\\'s--fine!\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nMy dear good uncle has arranged to have all Mr. Wickham\\'s debts paid and\\nmy father is to settle an allowance on Lydia.\\n\\n\\nJANE.\\n\\nBut where are they? What are they going to do?\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nMy father is coming home at once. He may be here at any moment. At first\\nhe would not consent to let Lydia and Wickham come to us, but my aunt\\nand uncle urged it--and my father knew how anxious mamma would be--and\\nso _they_ are coming here too.\\n\\n\\nJANE.\\n\\nAt once?\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nYes, directly, to-day.\\n\\n\\nMRS. BENNET.\\n\\nOh, my dear Lydia! How I long to see her, and to see my dear Wickham\\ntoo. But the clothes, the wedding clothes! I must write to my Sister\\nGardiner about them directly.\\n\\n[_She tries to get out of the chair._]\\n\\n\\nJANE.\\n\\nOh, mamma, there is plenty of time for that.\\n\\n\\nMRS. BENNET.\\n\\nWell, perhaps so. My dear, dear Lydia! How merry we shall all be\\ntogether! I am so happy! Lydia married. She is Mrs. Wickham. How well it\\nsounds. My dear Jane, I must see about the clothes. We will settle with\\nyour father about the money later. Oh, I am in such a flutter! Here\\ncomes Hill. [HILL _enters with the bottle_.] My dear Hill, have you\\nheard the news? Miss Lydia is married and is coming home directly.\\n\\n\\nHILL.\\n\\nIndeed!\\n\\n\\nMRS. BENNET.\\n\\nYes, you shall all have a bowl of punch, to make merry for her wedding,\\nand I am going into the house to write about the clothes. [_To_ JANE,\\n_who is going with her_.] No, Jane, you stay where you are. I know what\\nI am about. Come, Hill. Think of it--Mrs. Wickham!\\n\\n     [_She goes out leaning on_ HILL\\'S _arm, leaving_ JANE and ELIZABETH\\n     together.]\\n\\nJANE.\\n\\nOh, Lizzy, how relieved and happy we should be. Is not it wonderful?\\n[_Anxiously._] Are you sure it is true? Have you told us all?\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nYes, Jane, it is true. They are really married. And for this we are to\\nbe thankful. In spite of Lydia\\'s folly and Wickham\\'s wretched character,\\nwe are to rejoice. How strange it is! Heigh-ho!\\n\\n\\nJANE.\\n\\n[_Putting out her hand for the letter which_ ELIZABETH _still carries_.]\\nMay not I read the letter, Lizzy?\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nNo, not now, dear. My aunt has some queer notions in her head. Later\\nperhaps. [_After a pause._] I am very sorry now that in my agitation I\\ntold Mr. Darcy about this wretched affair. Now that it has come out so\\nwell, he need never have known anything about it, and it would have\\nsaved me a great deal of mortification.\\n\\n\\nJANE.\\n\\nBut how would you ever have explained things to Charlotte and Mr.\\nCollins without his help? Mr. Darcy made everything so smooth and\\nplausible for your sudden departure.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nYes, that is true.\\n\\n\\nJANE.\\n\\nReally, Lizzy, I think I shall have to take up the cudgels in Mr.\\nDarcy\\'s defence. His kindness to you has quite won my heart, and his\\namazing proposal was certainly a most flattering compliment. Why can you\\nsee no good in Mr. Darcy, Lizzy? You were always so full of excuses for\\nWickham, though it is true his open and delightful manners deceived us\\nall.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nYes, there certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of\\nthose two young men. One has all the goodness and the other all the\\nappearance of it.\\n\\n\\nJANE.\\n\\nI never thought Mr. Darcy so deficient in the appearance of it as you\\ndid, and he certainly could hardly have had the friends he has if he did\\nnot possess some good qualities. [_Shyly._] Lizzy, have you heard that\\nMr. Bingley is back in Netherfield?\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\n[_Astonished._] Oh, Jane, no. When did he come? Have you seen him?\\n\\n\\nJANE.\\n\\nNo; I hardly expect to see him.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\n[_Brightly._] Yes, you will, if he has returned. [_Suddenly clapping her\\nhands._] Oh, I understand. [_Kissing her._] My darling Jane, you are\\ngoing to be very happy!\\n\\n\\nJANE.\\n\\nLizzy dear--don\\'t, don\\'t. That is all over now, and besides I don\\'t want\\nto be happy unless you can be, too.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nOh, forty Mr. Bingleys wouldn\\'t make me happy. Till I have your\\ndisposition, I never can have happiness. No, no, let me shift for\\nmyself. Perhaps if I have very good luck I may meet with another Mr.\\nCollins in time.\\n\\n\\nHARRIS.\\n\\n[_Entering._] Mr. Bennet has returned, Madam, and is looking for you.\\n\\n\\nJANE.\\n\\nPapa returned!\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nWhere is he, Harris? [_Looking off._] There he comes! Papa!\\n\\n     [_They run to meet_ MR. BENNET, _and, bringing him in, seat him in\\n     a garden chair, one on either side of him_.]\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nPapa, tell us all about it quickly--quickly.\\n\\n\\nJANE.\\n\\nAre they really married, papa?\\n\\n\\nMR. BENNET.\\n\\nYes, that misfortune is well settled on them. They are married fast\\nenough.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nAnd where are they? When will they be here?\\n\\n\\nMR. BENNET.\\n\\nI should say they would be here directly. I didn\\'t care to travel with\\nthem, but they are not far behind--only just far enough to keep out of\\nthe dust of my post chaise.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nDear papa--how you must have suffered!\\n\\n\\nMR. BENNET.\\n\\nSay nothing of that--who should suffer but myself? It has been my own\\ndoing, and I ought to feel it.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nYou must not be too severe upon yourself.\\n\\n\\nMR. BENNET.\\n\\nYou may well warn me against such an evil. No, Lizzy, let me once in my\\nlife feel how much I have been to blame. The impression will pass away\\nsoon enough.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nBut, papa, how did you persuade them to marry?\\n\\n\\nMR. BENNET.\\n\\nI didn\\'t persuade them; I haven\\'t the means. It is all your uncle\\'s\\ndoing. He has managed to buy Wickham for us.\\n\\n\\nJANE.\\n\\nOh, dear good uncle!\\n\\n\\nMR. BENNET.\\n\\n[_Looks at_ JANE _quizzically_.] But there are two things that I want\\nvery much to know--one is how much money your uncle has laid down to\\nbring it about, and the other, how I am ever to pay him.\\n\\n\\nJANE.\\n\\nBut my uncle did not do it all?\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nNo, papa. My Aunt Gardiner has written me that you are to give Lydia an\\nallowance.\\n\\n\\nMR. BENNET.\\n\\nYes, one hundred a year. Do you think that any man in his proper senses\\nwould marry Lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred a year?\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nThat is very true, though it had not occurred to me before. Oh, it must\\nbe my uncle\\'s doings. Generous man! I am afraid he has distressed\\nhimself. A small sum could not do all this.\\n\\n\\nMR. BENNET.\\n\\nNo, Wickham\\'s a fool if he takes Lydia with a farthing less than ten\\nthousand pounds. I should be sorry to think so ill of him in the very\\nbeginning of our relationship.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nTen thousand pounds! Heaven forbid! How is one-half such a sum to be\\nrepaid?\\n\\n\\nMR. BENNET.\\n\\nThat is what I should like to know.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nWell, my uncle\\'s kindness can never be requited. If such goodness as his\\ndoes not make Lydia miserable, then she will never deserve to be happy.\\n\\n[_Laughter and voices are heard outside._]\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nSurely I hear voices. [_Looking off._] Why, they have come. See\\npapa--Jane--there are Lydia and Wickham.\\n\\n\\nMR. BENNET.\\n\\nYes, here they are. I will go to the library. I can receive their\\ncongratulations later. You know I am prodigiously fond of Wickham,\\nLizzy. I defy even Sir William Lucas himself to produce a more valuable\\nson-in-law.\\n\\n[_He goes out._]\\n\\n\\nJANE.\\n\\nI must run and tell mamma.\\n\\n     [_She is just starting when_ WICKHAM _and_ LYDIA _enter. They are\\n     in travelling dress and are followed by servants bringing all sorts\\n     of bandboxes, wraps and parcels. They come in with the utmost\\n     unconcern and no shadow of shame._]\\n\\nLYDIA.\\n\\nWell, Jane, well, Lizzy, here we are!\\n\\n\\nWICKHAM.\\n\\n[_Smiling and unabashed._] My sister, Jane--My sister Elizabeth.\\n\\n     [_He kisses their hands._ JANE _and_ ELIZABETH _are confused and\\n     blushing. Neither_ WICKHAM _nor_ LYDIA _is in the least\\n     discomposed_.]\\n\\nLYDIA.\\n\\n[_Looking about._] Good gracious! Here I am again! I am sure I had no\\nidea of being married when I went away, though I thought it would be\\nvery good fun if I was. Why don\\'t you take the boxes in, Harris?\\nWickham, have you seen my pink-flowered bandbox? [_Looking over the\\nparcels._] No, it isn\\'t here. Oh, my dear Wickham, do go fetch it--you\\nknow \\'tis the box with the white satin hat you bought me. I wouldn\\'t\\nlose it for the world. Go, go!\\n\\n\\nWICKHAM.\\n\\nCertainly, my dear. [_To the girls._] You see how eagerly I embrace my\\nnew opportunities!\\n\\n[_He runs out, laughing._]\\n\\n\\nLYDIA.\\n\\n[_To_ ELIZABETH _and_ JANE.] Oh, girls, I am dying to give you an\\naccount of my wedding.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nI think there cannot be too little said on that subject.\\n\\n\\nLYDIA.\\n\\nLa, you are so strange. But Jane wants to hear, I know. Anyway, I want\\nto tell you. Well, there was such a fuss! My aunt was preaching and\\ntalking away to me all the time I was dressing, just as if she was\\nreading a sermon. I didn\\'t hear one word in ten of it all. I was\\nthinking of my dear Wickham. I longed to know whether he would be\\nmarried in his blue coat. Well, we got to church, and then my uncle gave\\nme a fright after we got there, because he was so late, and he was going\\nto give me away, you know. But then, if he hadn\\'t come, Mr. Darcy might\\nhave done as well.\\n\\n\\nJANE AND ELIZABETH.\\n\\nMr. Darcy!\\n\\n\\nLYDIA.\\n\\nOh, yes, Darcy was there. He came along with Wickham. [_Suddenly\\nstopping._] But gracious me! I quite forgot. I ought not to have said a\\nword about it. I promised them as faithfully--what will Wickham say? It\\nwas to be such a secret.\\n\\n\\nJANE.\\n\\nIf it was to be a secret, Lydia, say not another word on the subject. We\\nshall ask you no questions.\\n\\n[ELIZABETH _looks most anxious, but says nothing_.]\\n\\n\\nLYDIA.\\n\\nThank you--for if you did, I should certainly tell you all, and then\\nWickham would be angry. [_She sees_ MRS. BENNET, _who enters in great\\nexcitement from the house_.] Oh, there is mamma.\\n\\n     [_They rush into each other\\'s arms._ WICKHAM _returns at about the\\n     same time_.]\\n\\nMRS. BENNET.\\n\\nOh, my dear, dear Lydia! [_To_ WICKHAM _with affectionate warmth_.] My\\ndear Wickham!\\n\\n[_They also embrace._]\\n\\n\\nLYDIA.\\n\\nOh, mamma! Aren\\'t you glad to see us? [WICKHAM _turns and talks to_ JANE\\n_and_ ELIZABETH.] Do all the people hereabouts know that I am married? I\\nwas afraid they might not, and so I let my hand just rest on the\\nwindow-frame outside the carriage, so that everybody could see my\\nwedding ring; and then I bowed and smiled like everything.\\n\\n\\nMRS. BENNET.\\n\\nYou may be sure, my dear, that everybody will rejoice with us in our\\ngood luck. [_Sighing._] Your marriage is a great compensation to me\\nafter all my disappointment about Jane and Lizzy. I do not blame Jane,\\nfor she would have got Mr. Bingley if she could. But Lizzy! Oh, Lydia,\\nit is very hard to think she might now have been Mrs. Collins! But how\\nabout your clothes?\\n\\n\\nLYDIA.\\n\\nOh, I have a lot already. You may be sure I would not forget _them_.\\n\\n\\nMRS. BENNET.\\n\\n[_Alarmed._] But you didn\\'t know the best warehouses! Well, never mind,\\nwe will see to that later. Now you must all come in and have dinner.\\nYou must be famished. Come, girls. Come, my dear Wickham.\\n\\n     [_They all go toward the house. At the door_ LYDIA _pushes_ JANE\\n     _back_.]\\n\\nLYDIA.\\n\\nAh, Jane, I take your place now. I go first because I am a married\\nwoman.\\n\\n     [_They all go into the house. After a pause_, HARRIS\\'S _voice is\\n     heard outside_.]\\n\\nHARRIS.\\n\\nWill not you come into the house, Madam?\\n\\n\\nLADY CATHERINE.\\n\\n[_Entering, followed by_ HARRIS.] No, I prefer to remain here. Tell Miss\\nElizabeth Bennet that a lady wishes to see her at once. Remember, I\\ncannot be kept waiting.\\n\\n\\nHARRIS.\\n\\nYes, Madam. [_He bows and goes out._]\\n\\n\\nLADY CATHERINE.\\n\\n[_Looks about her with a sniff, then deliberately seats herself in the\\nbig garden chair with the umbrella over it. She mutters to herself from\\ntime to time and taps her foot impatiently._] Insufferable impudence!\\nConceited little minx! She shall have a piece of my mind.\\n\\n[ELIZABETH _comes to her from the house_.]\\n\\n\\nLADY CATHERINE.\\n\\n[_Without moving._] Miss Bennet, you can be at no loss to understand the\\nreason of my journey hither. Your own heart--your own conscience must\\ntell you why I come.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\n[_In unaffected astonishment._] Indeed, you are mistaken, Madam. I am\\nnot at all able to account for the honour of seeing you here.\\n\\n\\nLADY CATHERINE.\\n\\nMiss Bennet, you ought to know that I am not to be trifled with. I have\\njust been told that you--that Miss Elizabeth Bennet would in all\\nlikelihood be soon married to my nephew, Mr. Darcy. Though I know it to\\nbe a scandalous falsehood, I instantly resolved on setting off for this\\nplace that I might make my sentiments known to you.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\n[_With astonishment and disdain._] If you believed it impossible to be\\ntrue, I wonder you took the trouble of coming so far. What could your\\nLadyship propose by it?\\n\\n\\nLADY CATHERINE.\\n\\nAt once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\n[_Coolly._] Your coming to Longbourn to see me and my family, will be\\nrather a confirmation of it, if indeed such a report is in existence.\\n\\n\\nLADY CATHERINE.\\n\\nIf! Do you then pretend to be ignorant of it? Do you not know that such\\na report is spread about?\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nI never heard that it was.\\n\\n\\nLADY CATHERINE.\\n\\nAnd can you likewise declare that there is no foundation for it?\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nYour Ladyship may ask questions which I shall not choose to answer.\\n\\n\\nLADY CATHERINE.\\n\\nThis is not to be borne. Miss Bennet, I insist upon being satisfied. Has\\nhe--has my nephew made you an offer of marriage?\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nYour Ladyship has declared it to be impossible.\\n\\n\\nLADY CATHERINE.\\n\\nIt ought to be so. But your arts and allurements may have made him\\nforget what he owes to himself and to all his family. You may have drawn\\nhim in.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nIf I have, I shall be the last person to confess it.\\n\\n\\nLADY CATHERINE.\\n\\nMiss Bennet, do you know who I am? I have not been accustomed to such\\nlanguage as this. I am Mr. Darcy\\'s own aunt, and am entitled to know all\\nhis dearest concerns.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nBut you are not entitled to know _mine_.\\n\\n\\nLADY CATHERINE.\\n\\nLet me be rightly understood. This match can never take place. No,\\nnever. Mr. Darcy is engaged to my daughter. Now what have you got to\\nsay?\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nOnly this--that if it is so, you can have no reason to suppose Mr. Darcy\\nwill make an offer to me.\\n\\n\\nLADY CATHERINE.\\n\\n[_Hesitating._] The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind. While\\nin their cradles, my sister and I planned their union. Do you pay no\\nregard to the wishes of his friends? Do not you see that honour,\\ndecorum--nay, interest, forbid you marrying my nephew? Yes _interest_,\\nMiss Bennet. For you will be slighted and despised by everyone connected\\nwith him!\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nThese are heavy misfortunes. But the wife of Mr. Darcy must have such\\nextraordinary sources of happiness that she could have no cause to\\nrepine.\\n\\n\\nLADY CATHERINE.\\n\\n[_In a rage._] Obstinate, headstrong girl! Tell me once for all--are you\\nengaged to my nephew?\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\n[_Hesitates, then firmly._] I am not.\\n\\n\\nLADY CATHERINE.\\n\\n[_Relieved._] And will you promise me never to enter into such an\\nengagement?\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nI will make no promise of the kind.\\n\\n\\nLADY CATHERINE.\\n\\nMiss Bennet, I am shocked and astonished. I shall not go away until you\\nhave given me the assurance I require.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nAnd I certainly never shall give it. I must beg, therefore, to be\\nimportuned no further on the subject.\\n\\n\\nLADY CATHERINE.\\n\\n[_In a fury, but trying to speak calmly._] Not so hasty, if you please.\\nI had hoped to spare you this last humiliation--but your insolence\\nforbids it. I am no stranger to the particulars of your sister\\'s\\ninfamous elopement. I know all! The young man\\'s marrying her was a\\npatched-up business at the expense of _my nephew_. [ELIZABETH _starts\\nviolently_.] Oh, you needn\\'t start, Miss! Nobody knows about the whole\\naffair better than you. But I don\\'t wonder you blush to find yourself\\ndiscovered. You used your arts well. My nephew must have spent full five\\nor six thousand pounds to save your family from disgrace. I should think\\nthat such generosity might appeal a little to your gratitude and your\\nsense of decency.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\n[_Amazed._] Oh, Madam,--I----\\n\\nLADY CATHERINE.\\n\\nIt is quite useless to protest. I have my facts from the best authority.\\nHeaven knows Darcy has reason enough to keep away from Wickham\\'s\\nflirtations and entanglements, but [_stopping herself._] that is a\\nfamily affair. However, _you_ have managed to get him mixed up in them\\nagain to the extent of five thousand pounds. But that is not\\nenough,--you want to make this shameless girl my nephew\\'s _sister_, and\\nthe son of his father\\'s steward his brother. Heaven and Earth! Are the\\nshades of Pemberley to be thus polluted?\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\n[_Speaking with great effort._] Madam, you have insulted me in every\\npossible manner. I must beg to return to the house. This is beyond\\nendurance.\\n\\n\\nLADY CATHERINE.\\n\\nSelfish girl! You are then resolved to have him?\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nLady Catherine, I have nothing further to say.\\n\\n\\nLADY CATHERINE.\\n\\n[_Rising from her chair._] Very well. I shall now know how to act. Do\\nnot imagine your ambition will be gratified. Depend upon it, I shall\\ncarry my point. [_Going._] I take no leave of you, Miss Bennet. You\\ndeserve no such attention. You will see what it is to rouse my\\ndispleasure.\\n\\n[LADY CATHERINE _goes out_.]\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\n[_Sinking upon the garden seat, overwhelmed._] Can it be possible? Do we\\nowe all this to Darcy? Oh, it is intolerable! [_She puts her hands over\\nher face in an abandonment of grief._]\\n\\n\\nJANE.\\n\\n[_Is heard outside calling._] Lizzy! Lizzy! [_She enters, and on seeing\\nher sister rushes to her._] Lizzy dear! What is it? Is there any new\\ntrouble?\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\n[_Throwing her arms about her sister._] Oh, Jane, Jane! Yes, there is\\nno end of trouble. Lady Catherine has been here.\\n\\n\\nJANE.\\n\\n[_Astounded._] Lady Catherine!\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nYes, yes, and--she says--that--oh, Jane----\\n\\nJANE.\\n\\n[_Distressed._] _Tell_ me, Lizzy!\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nShe says it was Darcy who paid all the money to Wickham--it was Darcy\\nsaved us--and--and she says I persuaded him. _I_ ensnared him, and--and\\nshe has insulted me.\\n\\n\\nJANE.\\n\\nMy dear, dear Lizzy. There _must_ be some mistake. It was my good uncle\\nwho----\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\n[_A little calmer._] No--no, Jane, it must be true. I can put things\\ntogether now. My aunt\\'s hints in the letter--you know I did not want to\\nshow it you. Then what Lydia let fall, and her fear of Wickham\\'s anger.\\n\\n\\nJANE.\\n\\n[_Soothingly._] Well, dear, even so, Mr. Darcy\\'s _motive_ is clear\\nenough--and that should give you no pain.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nYou are mistaken. I know his motive. He feels that he is responsible\\nbecause he was silent about Wickham\\'s true character. He told me that\\nall this would never have happened, had he done his duty. And now, he\\nwill despise us. He will never wish to see us again as long as he lives!\\n\\n[_She walks up and down in great excitement._]\\n\\n\\nHARRIS.\\n\\n[_Entering; to_ JANE.] The young gentlemen from Netherfield, Madam. I\\ntold them they would find you here.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nOh, Jane, I _cannot_ see them.\\n\\n     [_She tries to run away, but before she can escape_ BINGLEY\\n     _enters, all smiles, followed by_ DARCY, _who looks very much\\n     troubled and excited. They are both in riding dress_; DARCY\\n     _carries a whip_.]\\n\\nBINGLEY.\\n\\n[_Shaking hands._] Miss Bennet, I am so happy to see you again. Miss\\nElizabeth, it is good indeed to be back once more at Longbourn.\\n\\n[_He takes_ JANE _to a garden seat_.]\\n\\n\\nDARCY.\\n\\n[_Embarrassed._] Miss Bennet, believe me, I should not have followed my\\nfriend. I only expected to ride with him to the Lodge, but--but I met\\nmy aunt coming away from here, and from something she said, I feared,--I\\nimagined she might have offended--distressed you.\\n\\n[ELIZABETH _does not reply_.]\\n\\n\\nBINGLEY.\\n\\n[_Gaily._] Miss Bennet is going to show me the Hermitage. We shall be\\nback directly.\\n\\n[JANE _and_ BINGLEY _go out_.]\\n\\n\\nDARCY.\\n\\n[_Looking anxiously at_ ELIZABETH, _who remains silent_.] Forgive my\\nintrusion. I will go.\\n\\n[_He starts to go away._]\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\n[_Recovering herself._] No--stay, Mr. Darcy. Excuse my own incivility.\\nYour aunt\\'s visit has excited me. I shall be myself in a moment. [DARCY\\n_stands by, miserable. At length she speaks in a calmer tone._] Mr.\\nDarcy, your aunt has told me of our overwhelming obligation to you. You\\nmust let me thank you for your unexampled kindness to my poor sister.\\n\\n\\nDARCY.\\n\\n[_Exploding and banging his whip against his knees._]\\n\\nDamn!--Oh, I beg your pardon, Miss Bennet. I _beg_ your pardon. What\\nright has my aunt to meddle in my affairs? How _dare_ she give you such\\ndistress?\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nIt is far better that we know the truth, Mr. Darcy. For my part, I can\\nnever express to you our obligation.\\n\\n\\nDARCY.\\n\\nOh, Miss Bennet--I beg of you! The obligation was entirely my own. I\\nonly did what was my decent, plain duty. [_Faltering._] You remember--I\\ntold you--if I had spoken, this would never have happened.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nYes, I remember. But you exaggerated your responsibility. I--we--of\\ncourse my father will see you about your loan to us. I would not have\\nLady Catherine think----\\n\\nDARCY.\\n\\n[_Furious again._] Oh, I will settle matters with Lady Catherine! Have\\nno fears on that score, Miss Bennet. _She_ shall be set right, I assure\\nyou.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nThank you. And for all your trouble--your kindness--my family can never\\nrepay you.\\n\\n\\nDARCY.\\n\\nYour family owes me nothing. If I had any thought beyond my duty, it was\\na thought of--you. [ELIZABETH _turns away_.] Oh, pardon me. Perhaps, I\\nought not to say all this--but I owe you a great deal, Miss\\nBennet--more than you can know; and I want you to understand me better.\\nI really am not the pretentious prig I must have seemed to you. I wish\\nyou could forgive my abominable pride.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\n[_Looking at him with a half smile._] I will, on one condition.\\n\\n\\nDARCY.\\n\\nName it.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\nThat you forget my unwarrantable prejudice.\\n\\n\\nDARCY.\\n\\nOh, Miss Bennet! [_He goes impetuously forward--then restraining\\nhimself, smiles and looks down at her._] I really think, after all, I\\nshall have to be grateful to my aunt. She has done us an enormous\\nservice.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\n[_Smiling still more._] Well, Lady Catherine loves to be useful!\\n\\n     [_At the back of the scene_ BINGLEY _and_ JANE, _absorbed in each\\n     other, pass by, hand in hand_. ELIZABETH _looks at them, then turns\\n     to_ DARCY.]\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\n[_Archly._] Is _that_ by your permission?\\n\\n\\nDARCY.\\n\\n[_Ruefully._] Yes, I told you I had been kinder to my friend than to\\nmyself.\\n\\n     [ELIZABETH, _silent, still looks after_ BINGLEY _and_ JANE.]\\n\\nDARCY.\\n\\n[_Continues in a discouraged tone._] Well, I deserve it. It is my own\\nfault. My selfish conceit has wounded you past help. Every sentiment of\\nyour nature has felt it--seen it.\\n\\n\\nELIZABETH.\\n\\n[_Demurely._] But _one_ sentiment they say is _blind_.\\n\\n\\nDARCY.\\n\\n[_Stunned._] Miss Bennet! [ELIZABETH _looks up at him. He rushes toward\\nher._] Dearest, loveliest Elizabeth!\\n\\n[_He holds her in his arms._]\\n\\n\\nCURTAIN.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Pride and Prejudice, a play, by \\nMary Keith Medbery Mackaye\\n\\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, A PLAY ***\\n\\n***** This file should be named 37431-8.txt or 37431-8.zip *****\\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/3/7/4/3/37431/\\n\\nProduced by Chuck Greif and the Online Distributed\\nProofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net (This book was\\nproduced from scanned images of public domain material\\nfrom the Internet Archive.)\\n\\n\\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\\nwill be renamed.\\n\\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\\n\\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\\npeople in all walks of life.\\n\\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\\'s\\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\\n\\n\\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\n\\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\nstatus with the IRS.\\n\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\\n\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\n\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\n\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\\n\\n\\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\\nworks.\\n\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\\n\\n\\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\\n\\n\\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\\n\\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\\n\\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\n'"
